"Can I replace my Nokia 6.1 Processor and GPU with Nokia 8 processor and GPU? I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this question and I know you all are asking ""why would you wanna do that when you have a Nokia 8?""

"Android/Continue on PC/Link to Windows help please?  

This worked so well that I used in in lieu of Samsung Flow....until it doesn't. My phone is linked to my pc. I can send a tab from Edge or Firefox from my pc TO my Note10 without issue. However, every time I attempt the opposite, sending a tab from the Note to the pc, I get the spinning (looking for pc) thing and the ""get linked"" screen. I can text from my pc ""through"" the phone companion app, get my phones photos on the companion app on the pc, so it's obviously connected.

Samsung Flow however works so it's obviously not that the phone can't send the data....I've uninstalled, re-installed, cleared cache, checked for updates, etc. every thing I can think of.

"Do I have to take my phone to a service for water damage? My phone is a Xiaomi Redmi 5

To explain exactly, I dropped my phone in some water, basically just the upper part. I took it out quickly, wiped it up and (because I didn't know better) put it in rice overnight. That didn't do anything obviously, so after seeing it wasn't turning on this morning I opened up the back. I wiped the visible water with tissue paper and spent some time drying it with a hair dryer. I then left it open to air dry more for a few hours. When I could see no more condensation anywhere ( like on the lens of the front camera), I tried to turn it on again. 

It turned on fine, but there's an inch or so of water that got in a corner of the display area and it's visible.  I turned it back off, put it on its side on a tissue so the water would have somewhere to possibly come out. 

I asked a phone service out of curiosity if I did the right thing and they just said I should bring it ASAP - now, I don't know if it's cause of course they want to make money or just telling the truth. The cost of cleaning for liquid contact is pretty high and I'm not sure I can afford it right now.  So I'd like a few other opinions before I dish out the money I don't have :(",1

"Is there a way to add volume slider in the notification/control center panel? Is there a way to add a volume slider in the drop down menu?  I mean of course there are apps in playstore for that but if there is a convenient root solution possible for this that would be great.

The idea is simple. Like you swipe down, you bring down your notification/control center and at the bottom is a brightness slider, instead or just add an option for volume slider. Like in IOS control center. 

Now i can't use the typical iOS control center thing on my phone since I'm using OP6T android 10 oxygen os. Gesture based navigation (with swipe from left/right to go back)

I would always prefer a volume slider instead of a brightness slider or just an option to add two sliders.


The thing is, i hate using buttons, additionally i have a hard case on my phone so the buttons are hard to use.

I wish to operate my phone without any buttons, at all, i can open and close the screen, but there are times like i could adjust volume while listening to music, since Spotify doesn't provide that. 

This maybe a small thing for most people but this is exactly why i would've loved to use an iPhone 8 atleast. When you could easily access all your needs by swiping from bottom.

Its hard to imagine how everyone feels fine with this? No one genuinely cares about this? Especially those who have bad volume buttons or broken buttons. I hate to rely on buttons. This feels very, ancient. Especially when you have long phones, to reach the top with your finger in long phones is quite an inconvenience.

This is of course a very first world problem, but i guess in a world where people are trying to make everything as convenient as possible.. why not this?

(I do not wish to sound as a very rude person, if i do, i sincerely apologise, i guess i just feel a bit baffled about this omission in android when iOS users enjoy quite convenient and polished stuff like this)",1

"S7 Edge Bricked Hey everyone!

So i have a s7 edge bricked phone.

when  u power it up it says ""An error has occurred while updating the device  software. Use the emergency recover function in the smart switch pc  software""

While connected to pc,  the smart switch software says unsupported device also nothing pops up  in the emergency recovery funtion window.

So i tried  flashing the frimware (using odin 3.14.4)

Side note: i am unable to boot up the phone therefore can't access the buildnumber and idrk the phone's country

Phone model on back side: SM-G935FD

Odin mode (download) page details:

Download speed: Fast

Product name: SM-G935F

Current Binary: samsung official

System status: custom

FAP lock: ON

Secure download: enabled

Anyways i have tried these frimwares

G935FXXS8ETC3\_G935FANP8ETC1\_ANP||--||G935FXXS8ETC1\_G935FOXA8ETC1\_BTU||

G935FXXS6ESH5\_G935FOJV6ESH5\_THR =&gt; this one is older so it didnt work anyways

So the two mentioned above will always get stuck on system.img and will fail.

Any ideas will be appreciated, Thanks!

Updates:

Used Latest firmware for G935FD, gets stuck on system.img

Tried using USB 2 =&gt; No diffrence with USB 3

still haven't tried another cable

Tried on another laptop =&gt; Still gets stuck on system.img

Because of the growing tech, I'm so confused where to start with, I'm sure this is not a common syndrome, y'all must have successfully gone through times like these, kudos to you there!

I was taught C and Python at my university. After a bit of research, I have planned to start learning JAVA, and Android Studio. But my bad the internet has a lot of information, sometimes it's scary. I happen to come across ReactNative, which is definitely a cool platform to build applications with.

I'm sure there will be many more out there, I'm not preferring to learn Kotlin, I made my mind to learn either Java or ReactNative.

But here comes the problem, which one to use. If I had to use just Java and Android Studio, that would be great for me, but what about Cross-platform issues, I mean if I had to make my App available for iOS, etc, what framework would help me if I use Java. I got to know I can use Flutter with Dart. But that doesn't help my problem out, because without learning Java it is not easy to learn Dart/Kotlin.

Can someone share their experience, Also I'm confused about which resource should I learn Java/Android Studio.

I will be glad if anyone can help me out !.",1

"How is Android device being rooted or running LineageOS different from PC running ordinary PC operating system (Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, OS X)? Hello everyone! Recently my friend told me about problems with apps (mainly banking apps, but also some other apps) -- some of them refuse to perform some operations (or refuse to work at all) on AOSP-based or rooted firmwares. Some of them just check for root, while others also check for custom firmware (like LineageOS). I'd like to note that it's not like VLC on desktop that can be compiled to refuse to run as root -- these apps refuse to run if the user isn't restricted enough on their own device.

Some people say that ""itsforsecurity"" -- but desktop operating systems give you root (or administrator in Windows) during the installation process. Why are desktop versions of these same applications that don't run on rooted mobile devices, don't care about root on desktop?

* Force stop the Play Store and re-launch it: Helps with downloads stuck at 100%, but not any at a lesser percentage.
* Stop and Clear data for the Play Store
* Stop and Clear data for the Download Manager: Sometimes helps, but not often enough. If I don't stop the Play Store this also brings up a ""can't download"" error, but that doesn't change anything.

"Phone turned off during update, now won't launch. Got my phone (One plus 5) back from a repair shop today to fix a broken screen that happened months ago.

Screen worked no problem, I'm logging into everything again and start an update. I put it in a case and it must have held down the power button as the phone turned off.

I thought it would just restart, so I took it out the case and let it do its thing. It didn't restart, but turned off, and now won't boot properly.

When I hold down the power button, the One Plus bootloader comes on for a few seconds then disappears. 

When I hold vol up+boot, I go into recovery mode with the options to: START. Restart bootloader. Recovery mode. And Power off.

When I select Recovery mode, nothing happens after the initial loading screen. When I select Restart bootloader, I'm met with ""Fastboot mode"" and I'm taken back to the recovery mode options.

When I press power off, the phone simply goes black.

When I press start, the loading screen appears, but nothing after that.

Will I be able to access my phone and the files again? I've been waiting for my phone to be fixed for so long, and to have this happen is so saddening.

"Video ""driver"" issues? Video apps keep crashing. Over the last few days my P30 Pro has been having issues when playing videos. Usually this happens after I watch something, then let the app run (not manually close it) when turning off the screen. When I wake the phone and try to play a video, the current app will either give me a native ""cannot play this video"" error, or the the app will freeze and android will suggest a forced stop. When then navigating to another app, the same thing happens. The only remedy is a restart. 
This occurs with YouTube Vanced, Netflix, Crunchyroll and WOW+.. Which are all the video apps I have, so I'm guessing it's not the individual apps' fault, but a system wide issue.
My system is fully updated, but the problem did not start with a recent update or anything. I can't pinpoint anything that would have caused this.

"how to automate or silently configure device? Hallo,

I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results.

I'd like to do some configuration after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file.

It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended, and I'd like to do the same for my family's smartphones. Android does this - to an extent - by offering to restore from a previous device setup, but this option leaves out the most (for me) tedious task: setting up multiple email accounts.

What I mean is setting up the account, WiFi, and some more like setting some particular config items for the keyboard, display, notifications, ringtones, some privacy settings, more email accounts.

I tried Google Business G Suite but (to my understanding) explicitly says it does not push sensitive information like passwords - but that's exactly what I'd want to do - fully configure email accounts including pop/imap/ssl/smtp/password settings.

Is this feasible? When searching the web I find a lot of automation tools but for operating, not for setting up.

"Trouble installing Play Store on ex-corporate tablet I scored for 30 bucks an [Exertis SMB-H8005](https://sg.carousell.com/p/android-exertis-smb-h8005-16gb-239668813/) 8"" tablet running Nougat with 2 gigs of RAM. I'm not sure if it's a generic Chinese product or a specific OEM; it comes with [MobiControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.soti.mobicontrol.androidwork&amp;hl=en), apparently some kind of corporate access application, and that makes me think it was originally intended for staff use at some office or something and might have been purpose-designed (or at least purpose-configured out of the factory).

It would appear to be new old-stock as it still has the factory protector on the screen and no scratches whatsoever.

It comes with a few basic application, but the Play Store is not present. This is a situation I've found myself in before, and what I usually do is go to APKMirror and download the latest Play Store APK as well as the latest Google Play Services. Once both are installed it usually works.

Not this time, though - I just get the ""sign in"" button that doesn't work and a three-dots menu that gets me in a very sparse settings menu if I click ""settings"" and crashes the play store if I click ""updates"".

This isn't going to be some hacky performance machine, just a light-duty tab for watching films and occasional light Internet use, so worse comes to worst I can just sideload everything off of APKmirror - but that way I wouldn't get any updates unless I downloaded everything manually every time, which I can *not* be arsed doing.

Any idea on what I can try to get the Play Store to work?

Thanks.",1

"Chrome says I downloaded something that I certainly did not and it's not anywhere I look System Info:

Android 6.0 
Kernel 3.10.49

(Apologies for the formatting. I am on mobile)

So, not gonna lie, I was browsing a rather sketchy video site in chrome. No, it wasnt PornHub. It was a """"""Free"""""" video site where you could watch and download pretty much any kind of video from any website or streaming platform (YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, ~~OnlyFans,~~ HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Snapchat, etc. etc.)

As I was browsing, this download prompt from Chrome popped up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"". I already know that Flash doesn't have an Android app nor does Android does need an app for viewing flash content. So, I basically said ""FOH"" and clicked cancel. A short while later, another download prompt showed up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk"" as ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" already existed.

Obviously, I clicked cancel again, closed the site, backed out of Chrome entirely and began searching through my files. There was nothing in my downloads folder that was named ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" at all. There were, however, three randomly named ""part"" files in there which were created literally a minute before I started looking through my files (according to the details at least).

So I deleted the three part files and, to be on the safe side, I decided to revist the site to see if I could retrigger the download prompt. I know, that was probably stupid, but again, there was no ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" in my files, only the three last files. I figured that if it came again asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" then I'd know I got rid of it by deleting the part files.

But, when I went to the site again, the download prompt came up asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk."" instead. I NOOOOPED out of that again, closed the site, closed Chrome, and forced stopped Chrome.

So here is where my problem comes in.

I checked my downloads folder again and it's completely empty. I enabled ""Show Hidden Files"" and nothing comes up. I went and searched through the Chrome app data on both my phone and my SD Card and still nothing.

I opened up Chrome again and checked the download history and strangely enough, there was a ongoing download for ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" that I most certainly did NOT agree to. Chrome said that it was ""downloading"" the file and had downloaded 11.8MB out of 11.8MB. It seemed to be stuck trying to finish downloading the file, however. I watched it for like 30 seconds and it never seemed to finish. It also had the broken thumbnail icon next to it that (at least from what I've seen) comes up when Chrome tries and fails to download something or the file it downloaded is no longer in the folder Chrome downloaded it into.

There was an X next to the download that I clicked on to cancel the download, which it did, thankfully but it also just removed it from the list without telling me where it was downloading from or to.

I get that I'm probably, for all intents and purposes, fine since it looks like I interrupted it mid-download but I NEVER agreed to download this thing (Chrome didn't even let me know it was downloading the file) and that has me concerned.

What else can I do to make sure that this thing is legit gone?",1

"Android OS architecture/APK Question Good afternoon everyone. 

I have been wracking my brain over this for two days now, and I've decided to just ask the question. 

Backstory: My best Bros birthday is this weekend, he has kids and thus cant enjoy gaming as he once did. He plays teamfight tactics and legends of runeterra.

Now the question/issue, the first game Teamfight tactics can only run on a 64bit OS. So I was looking into a Samsung tab a 10.1, but after reviews I saw it was ""64-bit ARMv8-A(32 bit mode). As I do not have any tablets with this chipset/bit OS. I am unable to test. 

Could someone explain the difference in the ""32-bit mode on a 64 bit OS"", and just a 64 bit android OS?

Also since it says 32 bit mode does that mean it has the libraries to run 64 bit apps, meaning the mode auto switches?

Sorry if this is confusing, as I don't truly understand the architecture it's difficult to ask the question.

One situation is when I'm typing with my on-screen keyboard and the app I am typing on is on Dark Mode (e.g Chrome search bar).

This effect is also more noticeable when Night Light is turned on.

"Texting feature malfunctioning after last update, help is deeply appreciated as I rely on this feature... Phone: Samsung Galaxy A50

Android: version 10

After a recent update, my schedule text message feature quit working correctly. I have many health issues and heavily rely on this feature to communicate with my family. If someone could help it would be so appreciated.

The problem: The texts now send at random times as opposed to their scheduled times. For example, if I would schedule three texts at 7:00, 7:01, and 7:02, respectively, they would each send at that exact time. Now they might send at 7:06, 7:15, and 7:24. Basically the pattern has been: first text sends at completely random time, then each subsequent text schedules nine minutes after the last one. 

I also used to schedule three texts at one time, say 10:00am, but instead of all sending at 10:00 like they used to, they all break up and send at random times as well. Depending on what I'm trying to communicate, it's important they get sent at specified time.

I've used this feature for years on all my previous phones and this one, never a problem until last update.I can't find anyone to help because most people didn't even know this schedule text feature existed, even though its been available for quite some time.

"Problem with mobile networks after Android 10 update. Hello!
Since I have updated my Xiaomi MI A2 to Android 10 in January earlier this year, I am experiencing issues with my mobile network.

My carrier actually uses the network of another carrier, so in order to have mobile data working properly, a user has to:

1. enable roaming
2. turn off automatic network selection and select the carrier, which provides the network for them.

The problem appears when I want to turn the second option off. My phone returns me a message, saying: ""Couldn't find networks. Try again.""
I was able to make this change on Android 9, but since the phone has been updated, the network selection just does not work for me.

Looks like I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Another user, who owns a different phone and the same carrier  has also reported to me that he had very similar issues after updating to Android 10

My question is, whether anyone has experienced same issue after updating to the latest version of Android and if anyone knows what could fix the issue apart from downgrading the software.

I will appreciate all of your answers.
Thank you in advance.",1

"My fast charging isn't working. (Galaxy S8+)  

So yesterday I went to the grocery store, unplugged my phone as I normally would and came back to my truck. I plugged my phone back into the charger and immediately got the notification for ""moisture detected in the usb port"" (this was due to I suppose leftover condensation from a drink in my cupholder)

I followed the prompted steps, gave it a shake and let it air dry for about 1.5 hours. The icon was still in my notification bar, so I let it sit with a blow dryer about 2 feet away on the low/cool setting for roughly 30 minutes. My Usb port had to be dry and I even checked it pretty thoroughly considering. I saw several videos and threads online saying to restart your phone with the charging cable plugged in and the icon/notification would go away and I charge my s8+ via charging cable.

Well.. I can now charge my phone via USB.. only now it will start with saying ""fast charging"" and almost immediately switch over to just normal charging. It has even switched over to ""phone charging slowly""

"On buying a used S10 Plus, what are the do's and don'ts? Now I am going to buy an S10 plus sometime soon, but I need to know the things I gotta make sure of before buying it personally, here's what I'm thinking I should do

1. Dial * # 0 * # and go through each of the boxes to make sure there are no dead pixels, the screen works perfectly, the camera, and basically everything that thing does
2. (Maybe optional?) To remove all the accounts associated with the phone

4. Wait for the factory data reset to be over, then make sure the phone is not FPR locked

From my understanding the fpr lock only happens when you reset the phone from the bootloader, not from the settings; but if I did so from the settings it'll be fine.

Hey! I have a problem

# The problem

  
So the thing is that I have a Bluetooth headphone but its microphone is so horrible people can't understand me if I use it. So I'd like to use it only for output, and internal microphone as input on Discord.  
I know there are a lot of threads about this but either they don't work for me or there isn't any solution on it.

I thought about installing pulseaudio but  
\- it doesn't seem stable  
\- I don't know if it could allow me to do this (could it?)

# Solution #2

  
I also thought about another solution which could be disabling external microphones making them unusable at all, but I don't know if it's possible, and if it is, how?

# Solution #3

  
I also thought about preventing Android to detect the microphone on the headphones, making them recognized without microphone.

# Solution #4

  
Or I could make an application which allow me to do it, but how? Is it possible? It doesn't seem to be.

"Stolen phone still logged onto Google account however cannot be locked, located or erased A few months ago a burglar stole my phone when I was sleeping (I apparently sleep like a rock).  Now the phone is in use for some general YouTube watching by a seemingly harmless user (other than my watch history is sometimes very... strange). I was wondering if there is any way to leverage control over the Google account it is logged on to find/disable the device completely or find out the identity of the user. I imagine since the phone is still connected to the Google account it couldn't have been completely wiped. So most likely still has my data (and also my SD card). I tried to grasp at the general IPs that the account security throws out but as I am not a 'hacker' I've gotten only the district. It's a static public IPv4 domain. 
The device is a Xiaomi Redmi 7. Now thinking it *might've* been a mistake, I have also already removed the device from my Mi account.

"Kinda Nervous--Two versions of Google Photos on my Phone? *EDIT: Problem solved. It was a shortcut to the web version.*

I don't normally launch apps from my app drawer, as all of the major ones I use are shortcuts in folders in my homescreen tray.  With that said, I was browsing through my app drawer to see if I could free up some space by uninstalling apps, and I happened to notice two different Google Photos apps--one called **Google Photos**, and one called **Photos**.

I have the **Photos** app as a shortcut on my homescreen, so that one looked normal to me when I opened it.  I then opened **Google Photos** and things looked...a bit off.

There was a launch screen with the Google Photos icon on a white background (my phone is set to dark mode), and it said ""Google Photos"" at the bottom of the launch screen in Roboto Condensed, black font.  I know Google uses that font for things, but it just didn't seem ""Google official"" because I also know they don't use black text on their launch screens, and any font would be Product Sans.

Opening the app looked pretty official.  All of my photos and videos, even ones I had taken just minutes before, showed up, and the menu on the side had all of my regular account settings.  Aside from the fact that it wasn't in dark mode, everything there looked legit.

I went back to my app drawer, long tapped the **Google Photos **icon, and looked at the version.  Version 82.  The official **Photos** app I have is 4.51.0.315203446.

When in the info screen, I saw that the **Google Photos** app did say it was installed from the Google Play Store.  When I tapped that, it took me to the store, but it could not find the app.  I immediately uninstalled it, ran SD Maid, and then came here to post.

There were too many strikes against the **Google Photos** app to make me comfortable.  It had a slightly different looking splash screen.  It didn't follow the dark mode theme of my phone.  It was version 82.

I very rarely download anything on my phone maybe other than menus from restaurants, and I don't browse any sketchy websites.

So this first started on June 8th.  After I sent a message with a Youtube link in it, I never received any reply.  Turns out they never got that message.  On top of that, when I look at that message thread, it is titled ""No recipients"" instead of their names, and in the people section there are no names, just says add or remove people.

Weird, but whatever, I just make a new group and add them all in.  It works for a time, but I am often seeing Person A join, person B Left, you have become the group leader, etc.  There are sometimes more than 10 lines of this between any text messages.  Eventually, it takes everyone out and I cannot message them in it anymore.

So I make a 3rd group, and looking at it now, there is only 3 contacts in the group, so I don't think the 4th person is getting what I am sending.  To top this off, one of the people texted me stating that she is experiencing the exact same thing as me.

Does anyone know what is going on?  Is this related to the message issues other people are having?  And most importantly, is there any way to fix this?",1

"Phone restarts when inactive for a couple of seconds When I lock the phone or it locks by itself the phone reboots, also happened a couple of times while I was using it. The issue started after I downloaded a security patch a couple of days ago. I found a weird work around. If the phone is ""active"" in any way it doesn't reboot. So if I have Spotify playing music it will work normally, so I just turn the volume all the way down and that stops it from rebooting when the screen turns off. This is ofc not ideal.

I tried turning on in safe mode, it still rebooted.

I tried wiping the cache, it still rebooted.

The only troubleshooting thing to try I have left would be a factory reset which I would like to avoid. Any help would be great!

"-repeat- could my android have malware or been rooted without me knowing? I was looking through a younger siblings tablet the other day and I found a folder called ‘data’ then another folder called ‘data’. once you clicked it the top where the names are of the things you have been clicking is the name of a game in the format of ‘com.—whatever game—‘. the folders in the second ‘data’ folder were two folders named ‘head’ and I believe ‘service chat logs’. in the folder ‘head’ there were selfies of maybe five different people and two pictures that weren’t faces. The beginning of each of the pictures begins with either cache or cached and random numbers. two and a half years ago I used their tablet to go onto a chat app I frequently went on, since my phone was broke at the time. I can’t say for certain, but one of the photos looked kind of familiar, but as I said I can’t be for certain. the others I don’t really recognize.

When I tried to click the two files in the ‘chat service logs’ which were named that as well, I didn’t see their full names but they at least began with that. They couldn’t be opened due to I believe not having the app installed. I deleted that app on their 2+ years ago. I just wanted to bring this up because if it was from my app, why would it be under a folder that doesn’t have the apps name? also no other things were available in the data folder. I read online and saw that if you can access the two data folders that your device is rooted? I doubt a five year old could root a device, unless by accident? my other sibling took the sims card out a few months ago, could this be the reason? I just wanted to make sure there was no malware or anything that could have had access to the camera or microphone. that’s really the only suspicious stuff I saw. I believe we have always had that little box not clicked that says if we want to allow other apps that aren’t from google play. so I don’t think it was an outside app, but my sibling would sometimes play low quality games that I think were tailored to kids due to the amount of ads they would throw in. if anyone could give any insight that would be great, thanks! sorry for the repeated posts, but stuff like this scares me especially if there was the ability to access the microphone or camera without our knowledge.",1

"Android vs IOS differences  

**Update after finishing writing the post\***

**This was supposed to be a short question if someone has a text in favor of android against IOS that explains good, why we you should choose an android phone and not an iphone, but combine my Ritalin and my pretty fast typing, and you shall get a super long text about why I don't like iphone users as people, what do I think of tiktok and how I learned my English. if you have 3 minutes your welcome to read. I think it's worth it lol.**

Hello my fellow android users!

I am not too deep in rooting my phone or something, but I use an android. Now, I have tried an iphone, and did not like using it. the OS is just bad.. There are a lot of reasons to choose an android over an iphone, but when I try to write them.. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can't do it.

I live in Israel (Don't Involve Politics Please...) and In Israel, if you don't have an iphone you're basically a loser.

Apple took over in the subject of phones. It drives me nuts when someone who doesn't know anything just tells someone to buy an iphone and to throw that phone in the the bin.

I am not hating on Apple but I do hate like, 90% of their users. What I find is that the people with iphones are always the basic people, sometimes I find them just less intellgient (At least in my state) Not because they are using an iphone but I feel like it says A LOT about their personality, just basic people. I also seriously find the people who use reddit in Israel (not many) to be the same kind of people who use an android.. like, it's hard to explain but that's just how it is.

Also, most of the people who use TikTok are that type of iphone people! just, less smart... idk.. I often see a video on there that shows something that I understand how it is done, or that is fake or false and no one in the comment section is getting it.. For example:

""The man who didn't eat in 40 years, and is still alive!!"" and the whole comment section is like WHATTTT how?? so cooll!!

And it's obviously not possible.. I would give many better examples but I can't think of anything right now.

And about tiktok, I do use it and I think it's a fun app, I know reddit hates tiktok but it can be really fun, the app is not bad, it's working great, and my first impression when trying it was, Ok that, that's not bad.. There are cool options, the app is smooth, works perfectly and I barely see room for improvement.

(That's if you are putting aside the crap optimization for filming with an android phone)

Oh and, to put the iphone vs android thing in perspective.. there is that kind of video with:

""ok (thumbs up) not ok (thumbs down)"" and there was one sound that girls In israel used (reacting to) and It was like, ""He is great and everything but he has bad teeth"" (like 70% of the girls made the sign of not ok)

He is great and everything but he is jealous (Most girls went with ok)

and then, ""He is great and everything but he uses a samsung"" (like 80% of the girls went with not ok)

(Not ok means not gonna want as a boyfriend)

I watched like the top 50 videos with this sound, and as I said, 80% of girls went with not ok.

This. This is the type of a personality I am talking about.

It's just like, I imagine the girl I would date in the future to be from the type of people who use an android.. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe it is just in my state, I don't really know. Maybe what iphones has become made the group of people that do use an android to like, belong to that group of people? (Which I seem to like more and want to be friends with) (Not that I hate my mom or sister who owns an iphone but you probably get what I'm saying)

Anyway, there's a dude in my class who has an iphone 11 Pro and basically acts like he a king, and he thinks there is absolutely nothing that is close to his phone in terms of, like, begin a good phone, you know. In the mind of most people today in the community in my state android=garbage (Oh and also they say iphones vs samsung, they do not know about the existence of other android phones)

I feel like I need to write a text with the benefits of an android phone over an iphone, And I truly believe there are many, but I just can't seem to ducking do it. I need to send it to him, and to know it in generel lol.

Does anybody have like a text about that? I'd love to have a link to it.

Android is great, it's better in my opinion but although I believe there are many good things to it, I can't find more than 3 words to say. I really need that for an argument, Please ? :)

Oh and again, not hating on Apple, when they do things, they often make them just magically. and they did develop some cool stuff.

Sorry if there were English mistakes, I don't listen to the teacher in my English class since about 6th grade. I am learning mostly from browsing the web\\Playing Minecraft (No joke) And I am Still better than all of the kids in my class. I needed to speak and type in English since the first day I bought Minecraft, and from begin very bad at English and needing help after school I am now the best in class, I am in 9th grade and I feel like only now I am starting to get homework that's not super easy for me and some words that I actually don't really know yet. So, the English is Minecraft based. Blame them!",1

"Question About LG X Charge Hi! Sorry if this is a dumb question, I've been Googling and can't find the information I need. 

I live in America, use Cricket Wireless, and I have an LG X Charge purchased December 2018 and running Android 7.0. I just need to know whether or not this is a 64-bit device. Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, is [dropping support for 32-bit phones](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/11/pokemon-go-is-dropping-support-for-32-bit-android-phones/) at the beginning of August. It may seem inconsequential, but Pokemon Go has become a huge part of my life over the past year and a half. It's the main way my partner and I make time to spend with each other, a way we can go out and enjoy ourselves without spending money, and the cornerstone of our main group of friends. So losing access to it would be a pretty big personal blow, and I want to know if I can keep my current phone (which is just chugging along no problem, wasn't even going to replace it until next year at the earliest) or if I should start saving up now for a new one.

I'm on a super strict budget, so my phone was deliberately pretty low-end. I checked the specs of it to try to figure it out, and the LG X Charge does appear to have a 64-bit processor. But, I was told to use AIDA64 and look for ""x64"" or ""-64"" in the kernel version, and I was told my phone would not be 64-bit if it wasn't there. It isn't, which just confused me. If it's that my phone is 64-bit but my current OS isn't, is there a way that I could get my current OS to be 64-bit, or am I just out of luck? Thanks so much in advance!

"Motorola One Hyper and rooting questions. I have downloaded the factory original rom for my phone.

How do i patch the boot.img file before flashing to phone?  I know of Magisk but this needs to be installed on the phone and it only patches the current boot.img installed on the phone not one on a computer before loaded to phone.

Sorry to sound like an idiot. I have rooted a phone before ( Moto X Pure )
and it worked well.
This phone tho is newer and uncharted territory for me. There were programs and such for the X Pure
when i did it. This seems to be a command (adb) process only.

Finally, is there a different logo.img I can use ( I assume this is the boot animation file). Is this done via adb commands? 

I honestly do not want to brick this phone by being stupid. When I had my other phone TWRP was a breeze but this phone will not work with TWRP.

 I found these directions and got up to this point but confused from here on

 It is the time to start Magisk Manager v7.5.1 on XT2027-3 and choose Patch Boot Image File option to create the magisk_patched Boot Image File.

10. It is essential to select the stock boot img file that you have transferred to your XT2027-3.

11. It is the time to copy the magisk_patched Boot Image File from XT2027-3 to your desktop.

12. It is essential to put Motorola One Hyper (XT2027-1, XT2027-3) into fastboot mode.

13. It is the time to install magisk patched Boot Image File on XT2027-3 using the following command.

Magisk 7.5.1 on my phone has NO option to pick a boot.img file only INSTALL and that is it

"[Help] My mum's LG Rebel 4 shr uses through Simple Mobile upon bringing it home yesterday after an outing with my sister no longer connects to the network nor shoes it has a SIM or / IMEI number which I need to talk to her provider for help. What could have happened?! Hi all!

I've never had to post here and hope I am in the right place. But I am completely lost on how to fix my mums phone after exhausting the only ways I know of solving such an issue. 

So, long ass story as short as possible. 

My mum has an LG Rebel 4 bought through Simple Mobile as a gift. Not what I would have gotten her but I have an impulsive sister I'd like to murder right now. 

Yesterday she left and the phone was working fine. I even called her on her outing to see how she was. 

Jump three hours and I call to check on her again and get her voicemail. I now assume the battery suddenly died or my moronic sibling intentionally powered off the device. 

One hour later she comes home. I said I tried to reach her multiple times but she never got any calls and the phone was ON. 

What I found wrong and tried

She has no connection to her network. No data usage what so ever. It would not even let me turn the data properly on. It says on but I have no access to APN ( which I first thought was the issue because she never updates her phone and that was what I was trying to do as it has happened to me before). No success. Also can not update at all even when connected through WiFi. 

It can no longer  receive calls or make them nor can it send texts or receive them. Just suddenly?

So I have decided to call Simple Mobile which I am about to do but they asked in the prompts for the IMEI number. When I went to the Info for her phone there is no number listed where it is supposed to show the phone number connected to the device;  it also says ""Network Unknown"" and I briefly received a message I believe saying it could not fins the SIM (It came and went quickly.)

I have not tried a factory reset because it says all data in the phone will be lost but my concern is that if I do that all info about the phone will be erased from when I entered it to set up the phone in December. 
This is also a last resort and I have never had to do it with any of my phones or devices before. I am as you can tell not well versed in this kind of tech, I am in other areas but phones have always baffled me.

If any of this makes sense to one or some of you, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

How does this happen in the course of 4 hours?! I don't even understand it. It seems ludicrous to me. My mum is also not tech savvy and does not ""mess about"" with anything she doesn't know how to use properly first. Basically just the  browser and apps and such. 


Side note: Even as it is my mums phone my sister uses it when they are together almost daily. She deletes anything she does or tries to with little success. Could she have wiped or disconnected the phone from the network by accident?",1

"USB-C charger heating up unexpectedly..should I worry? Posted rn to r/android but was autoremoved due to spam.

"Ways to offer secondary verification of authenticity of an Android app I know a lot of FOSS projects publish to f-droid and that has a great system of using PGP signatures to verify the APK files.  What I'm curious about is how to verify apps deployed from the google playstore.  Now obviously PlayStore verifies the apps submitted but on more than one occasion, phishing apps that share a similar name have remained up for days.  Here are a few ways to verify the apps, that made sense to me.

1. Publish in your github repo, the full and proper playstore ID of your app
2. Publish in your github repo, the public key cert used to sign your app in playstore
3. Publish in your github repo, the full APK of your app via releases mechanism

\#1 is the simplest but isn't really cryptographically hardended.  Just makes sure the users type in the same URL you tell them to and hope there is no DNS hijack other exploits at play.

\#2 is nice since it is trivial to extract the signing cert from an installed APK and the cert fingerprint can be verified against the one in the source repo.  The signing cert never (or should never) changes so there is little maintenance this creates.  And finally, most any JDK / ADK install will be able to verify an APK against a given cert.

\#3 is probably the most complete since the user can checksum their installed APK against the one in the source repo, or simply install the one listed in the source repo.  This does put extra work on the developer since they need to remember to publish a release via github whenever they push a releast to Google.

I know it's paranoid, but there are some bitcoin Android apps that might warrant a heightened sense of paranoia.

Apps often crash when switching from one to another. Speaking of Google sheet, Fb Messenger, games like Pokémon (intended to stay active in background), etc. My previous S6 has absolutely no issue with that.


Is this a RAM issue? 


Why does rebooting my phone grant it some hours of immunity to that, until apps start crashing again when another is launched ? (clearing cache manually from all apps does not have any effect, only rebooting)

"Xiaomi a2 lite ram problem Hello reddit,

I have a problem with my year old Xiaomi A2 Lite.
The problem seems to be that my apps close in the background after some time of phone usage. When I restart the phone the apps can run normally in the background but after some time they stop doing so. In example I use a lot of youtube and instagram, I play something on youtube then switch to instagram, then back to youtube and it gives me the home page instead of the video that I was watching. I think this is somehow related to the phone RAM memory so I mentioned that in the title. Does anyone have the same issue or does anyone have a solution for this?

"Cleaning refurbished (and unlocked bootlocker) OP7 pro Hey guys,

I bought a ""new"" oneplus 7 pro from a chinese reseller.  
After opening the box I immediately understood that the phone was actually refurbished (marks showing the box was already opened, charging cable not nicely packed, with signs of previous use).  
The phone is in pristine condition so I see no real problem here.

The problems came later. The phone was already booted and waiting for me to start with the setup. I set it up, everything worked fine, until I tried to start netflix which told me the phone was not compatible. I wandered around on the internet and saw that it may mean that it has been rooted or the bootloader has been unlocked. I'm not too bad with IT but I've never rooted any of my mobile devices so it's a bit outside my domain of expertise. I also saw that GPay doesn't work on devices with bootloader unlocked so I tried to set it up and it failed.

At that point I rebooted the phone, and I saw the start-up warning that the bootloader is unlocked on this phone.

Is there a way that I can put everything back as factory-settings?

"Missing Google Account, can't backup Whatsapp Hi,

I got a really tricky one and I've spend hours trying to figure out what to do, though nothing worked so far.

**Basic Data**: 

* Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)
* Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop)
* Security Patch 1. November 2017

**The Problem**: The device is unable to connect to Google thus I'm unable to access the PlayStore. This is necessary since Whatsapp refuses to work until I update it to a more recent version.

Also Ive pulled some Updates and they went through flawlessly, but the phone stayed on 5.1 (saying its all up-to-date), eventhough the Internet says the J3 is upgradable to 7.1

**What I tried**: First I was thinking about readding the Google account, so I focused on that part. I restarted the device, cleared the cache of PlayStore, GooglePlayServices (GPS) and Download-Manager. Since that wasn't working I deactivated the GPS and uninstalled all updates of it reseting it to the factory version in the process. Normally this is fine as there isn't any crucial data stored in the GPS-Data. But then things got really weird. When I activated it again I recieved permanent crash-notifications of GPS. Re-Adding the Google-Account was also impossible as it just stayed at the first ""please Wait""-Screen while spamming the crash-notifications.

At that point I decided its no use and would be easier to just backup all data and reset the phone. Even more so as there really isn't much data on the phone. Just Contacts, Pics and Whatsapp.

Backing up Pics and Contacts is easy enough, but I can't get a backup of whatsapp. I managed to access whatsapp by disabling all outgoing connections and turning back the date to a date where it was still working. Once inside I turned to settings&gt;Chat&gt;Chat Backup and hit ""Backup Now"". A few seconds later it said it wasn't able to backup the chats to drive (which is expected and perfectly fine, since I just want a local Backup). The time of the last backup also got adjusted to the current time. When I checked the local storage under Whatsapp\\Backups i just hat two backups called something with settings and something with stickers, both with less than 1MB, so definetly not the chats. While looking for the Chats I found something in Whatsapp\\Databases. There was a file called msgstore.something, however it had just 6MB. Way to small to contain all chats including all media.

So I was thinking, is there some way to pull a backup using for example adb or another feature of whatsapp or Android, or is all this data lost? Also can I assume the problem to be solved once I reset the phone or can I expect the error to persist?",1

Pokemon go is removing support for 32-bit devices, and even though my phone is only a year old, it apparently falls in that category, though I looked up ways to circumvent this, and the only options I found are ones where you root the phone, which presents a problem as Pokemon Go does not let rooted phones access the game at all.

"Google assistant ""navigate home"" no longer working I frequently set up my phone in my car mount and start navigation to my house by saying ""OK Google, navigate home.""

"android 10 how do i get double tap zoom? okay this is ridiculous. i just upgraded to a google pixel 3a and i *love* the phone and i *love* most of android 10...

but first of all the screenshot feature change is objectively stupid.

second of all, double tap zoom was one of my most used features in earlier android. u double tap the screen (WITH ONE HAND), then slide (WITH ONE HAND) and u can zoom (FREELY, WITH ONE HAND).

how

do i get that back. 

triple tap is stupid to me. i never wanna triple tap the screen. the current gestures for double tap r useless to me. 

magnifier is awful. u triple tap with one hand and its a suddenly-fixed zoom and i have tons of problems with it. 

i searched a ton for this, but its all old irrelevant posts or a ton of things on how to use the magnifier and i despise magnify or whatever. i *love* double tap &amp; slide zoom and i used it *aaaalllll* the time. like constantly. how do i get that on android ten because its insanely frustrating.

also, if devs read this, u could have put double tap and slide into the settings as an option. ur google. that wouldnt be hard. no one at the offices was like ""hey, that was a good feature i used constantly?!""",1
"Uninstall All those Useless System Apps Android Smartphones always have some Pre-installed apps which you cannot Uninstall or disable and at some point you end up clicking those icons and then it starts loading. It annoys me alot! 
This post will help you to deal with this problem 


1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you.

"Sync notifications between devices? I have an old Nexus 9 tablet I still use from time to time, but one of the reasons I use it less often is the number of notifications I have to swipe away because I've already looked at them on my phone.

"messaging issues on wifi We have two phones in the household, both with MetroPCS wireless service and our home wifi. One is a Moto G5+ and one is a Moto G7 Power. The G5 has no network issues. The G7 has chronic messaging issues. The only app we're using for messaging is the default Messages app from Google. MMS messages often take 5-15 minutes to send, or won't send at all until we turn off wifi. SMS messages sometimes won't send either. When I say they won't send, they say ""sending"" for a long time, then say it failed. Sometime the only way to send multiple SMS messages in a row is to restart the phone between each message. It is frustratingly erratic, so we haven't been able to isolate conditions that consistently replicate the problem, but it happens often.

Our carrier confirms that the settings are correct. The SIM card is pretty old and has some slight signs of wear, but they charge to replace it (ugh), so we haven't tried that yet. (If taking the phone off wifi sometimes fixes the problem, does that mean it's not the SIM card?) Moto is still updating Android for the G7, and the phone itself is fully updated.

"Are the cameras in low-end 2020 Androids ""Good Enough""?  One of the biggest challenges with low-end devices has historically been the much-inferior camera. It's possible to get by with a slower CPU, less memory, and less/slower storage, but a poor camera is for many a tough pill to swallow, especially parents.

In 2020, with new ""low-end"" devices, is the camera ""good enough"" now to suffice for even critical shots, say for new parents wanting to capture images of their family?

I ask about relatively new or upcoming new low-end devices, such as:

* Moto E7
* Nokia 3.1+
* Samsung Galaxy A10e

Devices like these are ""relatively"" cheap ($200 or less, many available for a fraction of that when switching service.)

"Format SSD card to internal storage Hi,

I would like some help to format my ssd card to internal storage for my Huawei P8 Lite 2017.

To begin, this device doesn't have the native option to consider external storages as internal.   
Thus, I did the following things :

* Uninstall my phone drivers
* Install universal android drivers
* Plug my phone by USB and permit transfer
* Permit USB Debug mode

I then tried two different solutions that both failed. 

# The first solution I tried is using ""aftiss.cmd"" from [this forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/auto-formatting-sdcard-to-internal-t3583875).

The following code appeared :

    Auto-formatting SDCard to Internal and SDCard storage
    
    - Start ADB Server...
    - Connect to device...
    - Device: PRA-LX1
    - Formatting disk:179:192...
    Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: command '69 volume partition disk:179:192 mixed 25' failed with '400 69 Command failed'
    - Kill ADB Server...
    
    - Done =) -

# The second solution was using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). 

It failed to set force adoptable to true :

    * daemon started successfully
    HWPRA-H:/ $ sm list-disks
    disk:179:192
    HWPRA-H:/ $ sm set-force-adoptable true
    Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Adoptable storage not available on device with native FBE

And failed again to format the SD card :

    1|HWPRA-H:/ $ sm partition disk:179:192 mixed 75
    Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: command '70 volume partition disk:179:192 mixed 75' failed with '400 70 Command failed'

# I'm out of solution here. Can you help me to solve my problem please ?

By the way, the reason I want to do this is because I can only install apps on internal storage and my phone only got 16Gb of it. For information, my SD card is 128Gb from SanDisk.

"Help, Samsung A50 issue with SIM Card and battery/forced off Phone details - Samsung A50 (SM-A505U), Sprint carrier

Long story short, today out of nowhere my phone turned off and would not turn back on. After connecting to a charger the phone would start up but not boot to the main page. The boot cycle with the Samsung logo and Spring logo would just keep repeating. I removed the SIM card and the phone worked fine again, except for phone features obviously. When i reinserted the SIM card, however, the phone would turn off a few seconds later and would not restart unless I remove the SIM card and connect the phone to the charger first. 

I went to Sprint to replace the SIM card. Issue remains. They said its likely a battery issue, but they dont repair that phone there for some reason. The Sprint rep on the phone also believes its a battery issue as well. 

The only thing that happen today of note is that i was in an area with spotty service and i used 2 apps that i had not used in quite sometime. Both apps asked for permission to ""Manage my calls"" which i denied and continued using until the first crash. This is why i had been doing its a software issue. 

Has anyone run into any issues like this and know of any solutions? Thanks in advance.",1

"SD Card not accessible in some/most applications (Android 8.0.0) I switched to a larger SD card (32 GB &gt; 128 GB) and cannot access the new card or even the formerly used one in most applications. No changes in storage config or any system updates were done.

SD card mounted and recognised in 
[system settings](https://i.imgur.com/XZupAeH.png) and [file manager](https://i.imgur.com/LTi1vVw.png).

On one hand the SD card is not accessible in e.g. [osmand](https://i.imgur.com/S7hFHW1.png) or spotify or komoot or pretty much any other application (e.g. AndExplorer, DiskUsage, ...)


On the other hand photo / gallery apps (stock Sony, Google, and third party open source) see it, e.g. [smt gallery 6.8.2](https://i.imgur.com/pnJAJed.png).

It seems to me some apps interpret `/storage/emulated/0` as a link back to the built-in 32G memory instead of the external 128G SD card.

I tried so far without any changes in symptoms or results:

* formatting the card in the phone, using the built-in wizard when inserting a new blank card
* rebooting the device (in the last few days more than in the last few years...)
* changing the file system on the new and old card from exFAT to FAT32 and vice versa
* manually pointing some of the apps (where possible) to `/storage/emulated/0` or the older/deprecated `/storage/nnnn-nnnn/` paths

All cards are working, tested in card reader on Linux and Windows, also the SD card is visible (r/w) if I connect the phone via USB to a PC.

"Google Play Store constantly crashing I have a Samsung Tab S6 tablet (wifi only). Shortly after the last system update, Google Play Store started crashing. In the foreground, it crashes a few seconds after launch. If it runs in the background, I get a notice that it crashed every couple minutes.  I'm assuming some process wakes it in the background and it crashes in a similar time, since I don't see any apps updating.   I have to disable the app to use the tablet without constant crash notifications.  I mostly use it for reading, so this hasn't been too much of an inconvenience, but the apps area starting to get badly out of date.

So far I have tried

* Logging out of my Google Account and back in,
* Clearing app data.
* Resetting the app to factory and trying to let it update itself (still crashes)
* Sideloading the most recent version of the app from another device (still crashes)
* A virus scan on the device
* Samsung's built in log dump tools. I found the logs, but couldn't find any error messages relating to the crashes, though there's a lot of data there.

Anyone else experiencing this? Any pointers as to where I should look in the logs? I've got the Android dev environment installed on my desktop, though I mostly use it as a device simulator.

I have a Oneplus 5T, it runs LineageOS 16.0 (latest update) which is based on Android Pie. I run Nova as my launcher.

And it mostly happens when I switch from a 3D App (games like PoGo, Ingress and similar) to a 2D app (like Telegram or even the phone app when a call is incoming).  Infact, the most often occurence of this is me being in PoGo, getting a Telegram notification, tapping it, boom, blank screen.

"How to stop my headphones from changing the volume, skipping songs, opening music apps and Google Assistant? I have a Pocophone F1 right now, but this has happened with different devices and headphones. Basically if I move a bit the cable it can turn up or down the volume randomly. It may open Spotify, and if it was already opened then it'll skip songs. I turned off Google Assistant so it'd stop doing at least one thing, but instead it now asks me to turn it on. All of this because of a slight movement of my cable. Thing is it works fine with other devices, mainly my Nintendo Switch. So I know it is not an issue with my headphones, nor the cable. I used to believe it was with older phones and headphones, and sometimes they were the problem, but that was accompanied by a hearing loss from one of the sides, bad quality, etc., just anything you'd expect from broken headphones. This time the cable is pretty good, and as I said it works in other devices. My phone also works fine, it's just that something between the two doesn't work. Are there any permissions that have gone over my head so my headphones stop doing this? Thank you in advance",1
"Using REAL Wifi-Direct to mirror my PC screen on Android Hello,

So I'm looking for something that i can't manage to find. Maybe it doesn't exist or isn't possible. My real goal it's just to play games in my bed, so i want mirror my pc screen on my phone. I know their is a tone of apps that can do that BUT they all require the pc and the phone to be on the same network, something i can't do because i'm in a university accommodation where i can't connect my phone and my pc to the same network.   
So i know Wifi-Direct exist, and from what I understand it doesn't need the two devices to be on the same network, i mean that's one of its advantages so... But i only can find app that require both devices to be on the same network. Also it's seems that is possible to mirror an Android screen to a pc (using true wifi-direct) but i can't find the opposite.  
So this is where I am, if anyone knows an app that can you REAL Wifi-Direct for mirroring my PC screen to my phone it would be great ! And if you don't, do you think its possible to achieve something like this ? If it's not feel free to explain me why, i am curious about.

Edit : So tried spacedesk and chrome remote access. Spacedesk kinda a require both devices to be on the same network, but making a WiFi hotspot with my phone and connecting to it on my pc make the thing work, but yeah with some good lag. But still great for anything else but gaming. Chrome Remote Access is very simple, weirdly a little less lag but still no usable. I guess for very simple game that don't require reflexes it can be great, but my ""benchmark"" was Doom Eternal 😂",1

"USB settings &amp; Charging issues I've been having a ton of trouble for weeks now trying to **consistently** get:

* my phone to automatically start charging when I plug in a USB cable *while simultaneously* giving me a USB Connection notification where I can switch it from charging to File Transfer.

More often than not, it won't start charging and it won't give me a notification, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get to the USB Connection Settings by browsing through the settings menus. 

I'll have to turn off the phone and then it will charge fine, meaning there's no lint in the USB port causing connection issues. 

Sometimes it does give me a hidden notification when I pull down to check for it, and quite often when I click it, it is set to USB Controlled by Connected Device, instead of by the phone. When I try to switch it to phone, it'll switch for a few seconds before switching back to Connected Device. Even when I do get it to stick on either option, the actual USB option menu below it is [greyed out](https://imgur.com/ELVmIYi)

Sometimes it will toggle between the two, sounding the charging notification beep every 5 seconds or so.

I've been pulling my hair out for a while now, and I've found several threads online where tons of people have very similar issues accross all types of devices, including high-end Pixels and Samsung phones.

I am at my wit's end, so I decided to factory reset my phone. Before doing so I wanted to export my pics and files ( *is this really needed? What will be gone after a factory reset? Apps, login info, account info?* ) 
But guess what, I still haven't been able to get my Mac to recognize the phone and have been unable to transfer anything.

I've also enabled developer options and tried switching the USB DEFAULT options there, to no avail. I must have rebooted my phone like twelve times this morning.

Note, these issues started a few weeks ago, before then I never had any of these issues.

Am I wrong to think that charging the phone and transferring files should be very basic functions of a mobile phone and should just work **consistently** without having to enable a secret developer options menu while getting utterly frustrated? Google doesn't seem to have an answer from what I can tell. What gives?

For the past, probably almost a year now, the camera on my Galaxy Note 8 has not been functional. The flashlight also will not work. They both worked fine for the first few weeks, but now if i try to open the camera app, the app instantly crashes, showing the following message for a split second:

"[Rant/Help] My Note 8 might be on it's last legs and I need help with a decision... I was very happy with my Note 8 when I got it, and, in spite of some of the issues I've had with the fact that Samsung isn't stock Android, I haven't had a lot of regret about it. However, the device is getting older and I have been fine with using it for as long as I can.

Recently (about two to three months ago) I began having issues with the charging port until it eventually failed entirely.

I never really had to deal with phone repairs. The local tech guy I trust doesn't do phones so he referred me to Staples. 

Staples didn't repair it on site, so I had to wait a week and a half without a phone while they fixed it. They also made me sign something releasing them from liability from any damage to the phone.

In the end, when I got it back, the new charging port seemed to be working fine and I assumed I'd be able to keep the phone for another year or two before worrying about having to get something new. 

Yesterday I noticed my phone was again having issues with the charging port. It hasn't failed completely, but it keeps telling me it's not getting enough charge and giving full charge estimates of 25 hours. It charges wirelessly just fine.

Honestly I don't want to deal with Staples again. My expectation is that they will offer to repair it again, but I don't want to deal with another week and a half of waiting, only to possibly have to deal with yet another faulty charging pin. I use my phone too much to be comfortable with wireless charging only. Even though I use it a lot, it took quite awhile before I had an issue with the pin. I have no reason to believe that the latest pin issue is my fault.

But now I don't know what to do... ***should I find a better repair place to bring it to? Or should I just set up the phone as mobile device for my son to use and just replace the phone outright?*** I don't really enjoy having to replace the phone as I am someone who benefits from having a phone of a high quality, but that comes with a commensurate price increase that makes it difficult to afford them outright, but that's my best option when it comes to purchasing phones at the moment.

"How insecure is unsupported android? Many 3+ year old Android flagships stop getting security updates but still are pretty capable phones that could still be usable for a couple of years to come.

How risky is it actually to have an unsupported phone? 

If you read the latest android security bulletin

https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-06-01

It states: 

""The severity assessment is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed."" 

Does this mean that vanilla users that lock their phones, are educated about phishing and only install apps from google play store are anyways not affected by these threats? 

Or should unsupported android users be weary of using sensitive apps such as mobile banking, because it may be a matter of time until something goes wrong.",1
"[Q] Disabled Google Play / Store for Work. How to enable? Hi!  
Seemingly I posted into the wrong subreddit, as this does not beling on /r/Android.

"I'm new in the world of rooting, and I want to ask a few questions before I root my phone Hi everyone! A few months ago I acquired a new android phone and I'm probably planning to sell my old one, a Samsung Galaxy J5 Pro that was never rooted and has the Android 9 OS installed, so I backed-up all my personal files and opened the settings app to reset it to the default version, but then I thought that there are some files that at some point I've deleted, so I looked for a way to restore them if possible, because if I reset the phone, then I'll never be able to do it.

At that moment, I found a lot of apps that can help me with this, but some of the files I was looking for weren't there, so I realized that I could make a deeper scan if my phone is rooted, so that's the reason of why I'm here.

I investigated in various forums and videos, but I still have lots of questions, so I came to reddit for asking people that had already dealt with rooting and can probably help me.

I just want to root my phone for scanning the disk, and then ""unroot"" it, so I can sell it like a default phone, I'm almost sure that it's possible, but I prefer to ask first. So if it's possible, can someone explain me the easiest way to root it, and once I made the scan, ""unroot"" it, trying to be as harmless as possible?

"""100GB+ System"" in Settings - Adoptable storage bug? Hi there!

I recently started using adoptable storage and it has been working amazingly and solved the space issues I had perfectly. However, I now experience a super weird bug where in the phone's own storage settings, the system is shown as being 102GB in size. Both the PC when connected to the phone as well as my file manager show the phone with the ""correct"" filled SD card of \~42GB. I'm pretty sure this is a visual bug, does anyone know how to make the device settings show the correct value as well? It's not really annoying, but if it can be fixed I would do it.

"An update to a previous question about 'MMS not being sent to some contacts' Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/gw5h0t/mms_not_being_sent_to_some_contacts/

So after some trial and error, I have figured out a common thread that photographs (picture files that were created with my phone camera) are not being sent but other image files seem to pass unencumbered.  For example, if I take a screenshot of my phone screen or send a meme downloaded from reddit, the MMS seems to go through to any contact.  However, if I take a picture of my dinner and try to send it to my contacts, it seems to not go through.  It does not seem to matter if the picture is captured through the text messaging app or my camera app and then uploaded to the Text Messenger app.


Text-based MMS's do not seem unencumbered.

Because of this I think it might be a carrier problem?  I'm not sure though because there should not be a difference between a camera image file and an image file downloaded from the internet.


Running Android 9 and using the Messages app.  I did try some alternative Texting apps no difference (and that also leads me to believe it;s a carrier thing or a more fundamental issue with android 9)",1

"General connectivity issues Hey folks!

I just picked up the Black Shark 3 after being generally disappointed for most of a year with the Razer Phone 2. I got the EU version (I guess?) and have been having general issues with the wireless.

Periodically, almost the entire suite of wireless connectivity just drops. My WearOS watch (Ticwatch Pro 2020) will disconnect, and the custom watchface I use via Watchfaces disappears. Wifi usually keeps working so I may not notice the drop right away, but if I'm on my phone's cellular connection, nothing goes through even though it shows signal and LTE. In my car on my way home from work this morning I was on the phone with my captain, and the bluetooth connection to my car started cutting in and out, to the point that I had to turn bluetooth off to finish the call. There was no issue up to that point, while driving and listening to Audible.

I am suspecting/hoping it was user error in setting the device up. I backed up my RP2 to Google Drive, because I didn't want to lose my apps/data (I was mostly hoping my Swype settings and game logins would transfer over, since Swype died and I'm being a luddite, and the games require the hassle of 'transfer IDs') and have my text messages transfer over easily. I think it also possibly transferred the core device stuff like cellular and bluetooth settings as well, though am not sure.

Turning airplane mode on and off seems to 'reset' things and it'll reconnect to stuff, for a while again at least. I noticed I am somehow still getting at least some push notifications on my watch even though it shows as disconnected. I am a firefighter, on AT&amp;T's Firstnet, so am also not sure if maybe the Firstnet bands might be being finnicky with the BS3.

I also get the ""Xiaomi SIM activation failed"" alert every time I restart the phone, and sometimes after reboot the keyboard doesn't load. 😬 I get the feeling ill need to reflash again, but knowing where I went wrong first would help! Also curious if there is a stock Android ROM because this JoyUI seems a hassle, and I just don't want all the Xiaomi stuff.

I have ATT and know where I isually have service, and my family uses ATT too and their service is fine.

 I first noticed the weekend the COVID stuff started getting big, and thought it was just related service interruptions, but weeks went by and didnt improve. I started noticing that my cell service cut out every time I was charging my phone, and the past week or so noticed that the back of my phone would get really warm whenever the cell service cut out. Initially it would work again when I restarted my phone, at least for a few minutes, then the minutes became seconds,  and now there is nothing.  I also noticed that my battery was draining much faster than normal and my phone was even warmer.

I thought I had a bad SIM card, so I swapped it with some family members SIM cards from their iphones.  My card worked fine in their phones, but my phone still had no service with their cards.
I put my sim card in my 9 year old Pantech slide-out-keyboard phone (Almost made me wish we still used them, ha) and the pantech is working fine, making calls and all that.  Without the SIM card, my android's battery was draining normally again, and then later I noticed that it showed full cell signal bars. I was unable to make calls because it did t have a SIM card of course, but Im guessing I had full signal strength for any emergency calls?

Anyways,  is this probably a hardware issue and I just need a new phone? Or some error/glitch somewhere that I can fix? Ive factory reset my phone to no avail, as well as had ATT reset my connection from their end.
Or is there a more appropriate place to ask?",1
"Can you set a single/small group of contacts to not have any vibration without blocking them? Samsung galaxy s9 My family is terribly with timezones and they keep calling my phone at odd hours (they have a service that allows them to have a local number).

"Whats App Notification questions  

Hi All

So i like to customise my notifications for WhatsApp

One for group notification ( so i can ignore it lol )

One for direct to me

One for the SO...ECT

However, i only need ONE notification. Having Nes Scream ""PK CROSS!"" over and over again is great on smash bros but when the group chat is kicking off can be a little annoying to say the least.

My question to you all is.

Is there a way to limit the notification to once? It plays for the first message then just stops.

Thanks in advanced all and have a good day",1

"Someone called my Mum, and they could see her phone My Mum called me to tell me that someone had called her, purporting to be an amazon employee. He said that they had accidentally overcharged her and wanted to refund her the money. She said ok. He then said ""your phone battery is low, could you please plug it in"". Thing is, her phone battery was 2%, so it sounds like he really could see her screen. She plugged her phone in and then he said ""I need your bank details to credit the money back. Could you please log into your bank account on your phone.""
At this point my mum panicked and hung up. He called her back 3 times. 
She has called the bank and flagged it with them - no funny business has been identified.
My question is this: is her phone still safe to use? If not, is there anything we can do to make it safe to use?

"Can android 10 really supports ""Bubbles""? Well, knowing that the last android 11 developer preview enabled this feature for apps like Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger and so on I got curious... 

**Can Android 10 really supports this feature?** 

What I mean by that is, for example, if Telegram can enable that feature, so it will be available for both android versions (10 and 11).

**Or is it that this feature will only be available for Android 11?**

I know that there's like literally no apps that support this feature (the phone app kind of does but it could be like a Messenger integration) but then those messaging  apps that I mentioned [can use this feature, on android 11.](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-11-chat-bubbles-1085309/)

A few months back my mobile phone's hotspot stopped working and devices started showing can't connect to servers whenever i tried connecting to major sites like YouTube facebook google. However, strangely my business websites were working along with few other small scale websites out of my my country. Vlc media player could connect to subtitle providing servers. I checked my connection by connecting to google fb on my phone directly and they were working completely fine but i couldn't connect to them on any of my other devices which were using mobile's Hotspot.
Anyway i changed phone after that ( i was using nokia 6.1 plus) and started using asus max pro m1. things worked fine since then but today that same thing started happening again. I can't use my new phone's hotspot to work on my laptop and tablet when all sites are working on phone and few sites are working via hotspot (again not the big ones like fb google)

"Samsung Galaxy S8+ - Outlook App stopped syncing / sending notifications Hello,

I've had this Samsung Galaxy S8+ for the last year and installed the Outlook app day 1 for my hotmail account.  Up until the last few days there was no issues.  If a new email came in I got a notification on my phone and I could use that to bring up my email.

I noticed a day or two ago notifications weren't coming anymore.  I usually got a couple a day but nothing for a few days.  I went inside the app to open my email and there was no new emails.  It wasn't until I refreshed my emails within the app that all the new emails displayed.

To me it seems like the app is not syncing and sending notifications to my phone.

I've tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling.  Removing my email and readding from within the app.  Restarting the phone.  Going through App and Notification settings to see if anything looked odd but nothing.

Is there some sort of known issue I'm not aware of?  Or anything else I should be checking?  It seems minor but it is really bugging me.

"Stall having issues after factory reset, is my phone salvageable? I've had dozens of various glitches over the past few months. They're intermittent and random, so they can be difficult to replicate. They include registering taps as swipes, registering a tap somewhere else on the screen, or registering one that was never made, refusing to rotate, issues with massive back button lag, screen freezing, randomly dropping cell service, and other similar issues. 


Pixel 2 on Verizon, 2.5 years old, running Android 10, last security update 6/5. 


I tried the following: soft resets, virus scan, malware scan, deleting unused apps, booting in safe mode, removing the case, and a factory reset. 


The scans found nothing. Deleting apps didn't help. Safe mode was inconclusive since I can't find a reliable way to replicate the problems. Factory reset only got rid of about 25% of the problems. However, these ones actually got worse: tapping and scrolling issues, and dropped or delayed network (internet) signal.

So I have a Samsung S10e running android 10 (oneUI). Never really had too many problems but recently I have noticed - mainly with whatspp - that when a friend sends me a message, it doesn't come through on my phone, not as a notification nor when I open up the app. Then if I send a message it doesn't say sent, until I turn off my phones wifi and it goes onto 4G then I get all the messages and can send messages again.

"Rooting a Cubot King Kong 3 - a few general questions  Hello,

I'm interested in rooting a Cubot King Kong 3 phone (MT 6763 phone), which features Oreo 8.1.

For   my general understanding, I have a few questions and I really that   somebody is so kind to help me shed some light on the following:

1. Is   it possible to root any random phone just by unlocking the bootloader   with ADB, flashing TWRP and then installing SuperSU in the recovery?

Is   this the general approach I can use also on the Cubot King Kong 3? Or   do I need a TWRP which is modified / customized for this phone? I would   like to clarify this, before I do something and brick the phone.

2.   What are some safety measures to take, before trying to root, so that I   can reinstate the phone to the original state, if something goes  wrong?

3.  Do I have to disable  any kind of data partition encryption so that I  can root the phone? Or  can I still root the phone without doing this?

4.   What is a scatter file and for what is it used? I've read a lot of   guides and it seems to be used only with SPFlash. Does this mean, that I   do not need this, if root by going the ADB+TWRP+SuperSU route?

5. If after unlocking the bootloader with fastboot, I am getting the message  ""*Orange State Your devices has been unlocked* and *can't* be *trusted*. "" at boot, then what went wrong and can this be fixed?

6.   If after flashing the stock ROM, which Cubot provides on their forum, I   get a red text ""Not Verify"" in the upper right corner of the screen   every time the phone is on, then what went wrong and can this be fixed?

"Xiaomi mi note 10 photos are huge. Hello, I just bought the xiaomi mi note10 with the 108 mp Penta camera set up. I am loving it so far. However I have an issue. The camera app saves photos at a flie size too big to upload to discord(needs to be &lt;8mb). All my photos end up being 11mb or higher. Is there another camera app I can use that is compatible with the Penta camera that will make smaller file sizes? 

Alternatively is there a setting I can change to be able to make the files smaller?

"I've probably bricked my Pixel 3a. Greetings, I recently tried rooting my Google Pixel 3a via magisk. But I must've followed the directions incorrectly because I flashed the boot\_a and boot\_b with incompatible or broken software. I figured I would try to undo my mistakes and side load the OTA onto the phone. However when I try to use ""adb"" to side load the OTA it doesn't recognize my device. If I try to utilize any adb commands it doesn't recognize the device. I suspect the reasoning for this might be that the phone was factory reset during the flash, and that the settings which allows USB debugging was disabled. So it seems that I'm unable to use any adb commands to side load the OTA. Does anyone have any idea how I might be able to get a working android OS on the phone without adb? Thank you.

Some other key details:

The phone is stuck and cannot escape fastboot.

It cannot enter recovery mode.

It cannot enter rescue mode.

Boot slot: b

Enter reason: error boot prepare (I assume this is the error for why it's stuck in fastboot)

"Static in right side headphones when plugged in completely (4 poles) to android phone - was working previously - can plug in 3 poles but lose play/pause function by not having the 4th pole in -also not practical - what should I do when I disassemble to try and fix. Hello I have an android phone with which I use apple headphones they have worked perfectly for 3 years or however long before but last week they started causing static in the right side of the headphones.

First I thought it was the headphones then I bought 3 new headphones to replace them and for backups - I bought new headphones and tried them all and they all had the same static in the right headphone - the static is low and gives off a buzz feeling as in you can slightly feel the static of it as well like a very light vibration - when I click pause to pause audio the headphone audio pauses and the static carries on buzzing for a second then cuts off where you can hear the cut off and then the static stops - then press play and the static starts again with the audio - so when the audio is paused the electric stops going through it and stops causing the buzz.

So I bought a few 3.5mm male to female jacks to try out and found when the 4th pole that controls the mic and play/pause button is not plugged in the sound is perfect with no static but then you lose play/pause functionality and also this is not practical/sustainable to use with the last pole balancing in the port - then I tried old type 3 pole headphones into the 3.5mm jacks and they work perfect with no static but also no play/pause functionality on those type of headphones - also tried headset type (over-head type) headphones and they worked with no static.

So I have narrowed it down to the problem being the 4th pole that controls mic and play/pause functionality - I also tried the headphones in other devices and they work normal so it is definitely the phone that has had some type of damage that now causes static through the headphones.

Now I am going to disassemble the phone to see if anything is touching the headphone port or something I don't know what is wrong with it or what I should do though so does anybody know where to start.

Thanks.

"my phone keeps telling me an app is draining its battery I have Ccleaner installed on my phone for general cleaning.

I also have Houseparty installed. And ccleaner tells me every once in a while that Houseparty has drained like 40-50% of my battery. It's always the #1 app by far. I keep trying to close it thru Ccleaner but the draining still seems to happen (assuming it's the culprit). It also doesn't seem to be open/active so simply closing it doesn't seem to be the answer.

I should also mention, a bizarre thing that happens with this phone is that every once in a while I'll suddenly get like 20-50 alerts in rapid succession. For the longest time I had no idea what they were since when I picked up the phone there wasn't a clear explanation given. But I think it's Yahoo mail because I had the phone in my hands when it happened the last 3x. And interestingly enough it wasn't mail coming in - every second or so I saw there was less mail. Not sure what that's about. But is there a way of fixing that and could that also be the cause of my battery draining?

"Android 10 (OnePlus 8) download failing on battery Hi everyone,

I have an issue that I have discovered attempting to download a large Fortnite update on my OnePlus 8.

The download fails and the app states 'no internet connection' while on battery only, even when I have adequate reception while using mobile data. It does this after roughly 45 seconds on battery.

If the phone is plugged in, it will continue to download fine without stopping.

All of this is with the screen turned on, not while the phone is sleeping. I didn't think battery optimization settings should effect apps in use with the screen on. (If that's what's happening?)

"Question about passwords and how apps handle them. So I've been downloading a bunch of apps lately, lots of which require you to log in. Problem is, some of these apps, which are actually apps from large legitimate companies, when I type my password in, gboard will show the password at the top in the autocomplete suggestions in plain view as I type it for the first time. It then remembers my password, and whenever I type the first 2 or 3 letters, the password appears again for me to tap to auto fill it in. I could be typing anywhere, in any app, on any website, even in this reddit text box im typing in now, and if a word matches the first 2 or 3 letters, gboard shows my password again, plainly visible to anyone that can see my screen. As gboard is treating it as a normal learned word rather than a password, it's probably also storing it in plain text somewhere, rather than encrypting it like a password should be, and possibly exposing it to other apps. 

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but the developers of the apps that I'm typing my password in to (not the gboard app) should somehow be preventing this, right? Are they not properly coding their password box as a password or something? I could have sworn that other apps are somehow temporarily able to disable gboard's autocomplete while I'm typing a password. 

I sent feedback on one of the apps to the company and they just told me to turn off my autocomplete. I stopped using that app and cut ties with them because they obviously don't value password security.",1

"Android Phone Stuck in Fastboot **I have an LG Stylo 4. This is cross-posted, but I haven't gotten a response yet.**

My phone froze and crashed two days ago. I pulled it off the charger(that was connected to my PS4) and turned it back on using the power key, and it gave me a black screen with some white text in the corner. It said Fastboot Mode.

I had no clue what that even meant, so I started googling. I can follow basic, clear cut instructions, so I figured it shouldn't be too difficult. However, that rabbit hole was leading me very quickly into phone modding territory, and the most I've done to my Android is download a new theme from an app I'd downloaded on the Play Store.

It led also me to a lot of YouTube videos, and a lot of sketchy looking sites to download things like drivers, and software, and confusing instructions about using command prompts. 

I found one tutorial that looked promising, that instructed me to download something called Minimal ADB and Fastboot Tool, and I did my best. I THINK I have the software downloaded correctly. **(If I don't, would anyone be able to ""Explain Like I'm Five"" me through the setup of Minimal ADB and Fastboot Tool?)** I have a windows 10 laptop, and a good connector for the phone/laptop. 

I followed the instructions on a few youtube videos for ADB and Fastboot Tool, and found that ""fastboot devices"" picked up my phone(the numbers matched the ones on my screen), but ""fastboot reboot"" didn't do anything. I did it multiple times. In the youtube videos I watched, running this command made the phone in the video reboot, but mine did nothing. 

ADB gave me a ""devices 'null'"" error. I looked through the command prompts, but nothing else seemed to really be what I wanted, or that it would do anything outside the realm of destroying my phone. Also a dead end.

After finding nothing on how to troubleshoot either of these issues, I kind of gave up. 

I decided I'd try to let my phone just die naturally, with the hopes that I could stick it on the charger(that isn't connected to any kind of device like a laptop or a PS4), and I could try to boot it into recovery mode from there. However, as soon as it gets any charge at all, it just boots back up into Fastboot Mode, where I am effectively stuck.

**I know it's a long shot, but would anyone be able to point me in the right direction?**

I called a phone repair shop, but he kept calling Fastboot mode ""recovery mode"", which is not the same thing. He also said he may have to wipe the phone entirely, which is not ideal as it has photos of my dog that passed away recently on it, and I hadn't had a chance to back them up.

"My secondary phone keeps turning on its WiFi, even when I purposefully turn it off.

However lately after the screen turns off the speech pauses after about 1 minute of play, and will resume the second I turn the screen back on.

My phone is the OnePlus 7T, and I only started getting this problem after I installed the latest update.

Things I've tried that didn't work:

* Locking the app in the recent apps window

* Selected ""Don't Optimize"" under the battery optimization settings for this app.

* Disabled ""Sleep Standby Optimization""

* I've also tried testing it on different .epub files to see if it was specific to one ebook with special characters that trip up the TTS Engine, but the same thing happens with any book.

I'm fresh out of ideas, and hoping someone can recognize what the issue is.",1
Where can I find free templates for my android app? I am developing an android app in android studio and I really don't want to mess with all the layouts and styles too much. Is there a place I can find free templates for my app?,1
"Is it possible to live checkpoint/snapshot an app? Note I'm not talking about screenshotting an app.    

What I want is to save the exact state of an app (like any PC sandbox could do), and restore it at anytime.

I cannot find much information on Google, so I decided to ask here.    

Is it possible? If so, how?",1

"Reboot Wifi connectivity sporadically Hi, I have this bizarre issue that I have been facing for a long time.   
I have bought a new phone Samsung M30. The first day this phone has entered the house and I'm facing the problem where abruptly the wifi goes missing on this particular phone for awhile. in addition, all the connected devices on the router lose the wifi as well for about 10 seconds. so I have to turn off / then on in order to get wifi fo other devices. but for the M30 sometimes it takes a whole till it reconnects to the wifi.

at first, I thought the issue is within the M30. but I used this phone outside using another place's wifi. and it worked perfectly. didn't lose the wifi nor cutting the wifi on the connected devices.  
I tried to modify my routers settings, for instance, I read elsewhere if I enter the IPs of all the connected devices statically it might solve the issue. unfortunately, it hasn't.

I know what I'm saying might sound so odd and makes no sense. but I have no idea how to toggle this. like it took me time to figure out what I just described. I can provide further information tho.   
just if someone could walk with me through this. I'd highly appreciate it.

Android version: 9  
router model and information: TP-Link Modem Router / TD-W8961N

Firmware Version: 3.0.0 Build 180118 

in the house I have 8 devices. all are connected to this router. once Samsung M30 losses the wifi. so do all the connected devices. I have 3 Samsung devices. 2 LG and 2 HTC. along with laptops.  
I guess this device triggers the wifi for some unknown reason that causes the router to reboot the wifi. therefore all the connected devices lose the wifi as well.

Note: the M30 android version is the height among the other devices in the house.",1
"New (used) Pixel, how/should I check for malware/rootkit? Hi all.

I bought a refurbished Pixel 3a from a third party on Amazon.  It boots to the setup pages and only seems to have stock Google apps installed.  Is there a way to check for malware that doesn't involve unlocking or flashing?  If I find out what image is on there, can I dump that via ADB and compare the checksum to a known good image, or is there a better way?

If this concern is ridiculous and I should just do a factory reset and move on with life, let me know.",1
"Why does my phone keep calling my mother randomly? I have a new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, the folding one.  For some reason, my phone has randomly decided to call my mother for no reason and I don't know why.  This happens usually when I close the phone.  I was always silent when it happens, so it's not like it is listening for me to say ""call mom"" out loud.  I checked the lock screen and there's nothing I can tap on intentionally to call her, so I fail to see how it does this accidentally and repeatedly.  There's also nothing happening on the notification bar when the phone is closed.  What's causing this?",1
"Is it possible to root Samsung A71 without data loss? Hi, I just got a Samsung A71. I had finished getting it to my liking but realised I forgot to root it.

Is there any way I can root the device without losing any data?",1
"Is it normal for my phone to randomly show screenshot tipps? Hi guys, hope this is the right sub and someone can help me out. This has happened twice already and I think it is super weird: I was just browsing reddit on my phone through the browser. (Android 10 / MIUI / Chrome) All of a sudden there is this popup on my screen that reads ""Nimmst du viele Screenshots auf?"" which is german for ""Do you take a lot of screenshots?"" together with a picture and a message telling me that with some new google function I can edit my screenshots right away. This message got me super suspicious because at the moment it showed up I was not pressing any buttons and certainly not taking a screenshot - just reading through some posts in my browser. Is it normal for this message to just pop up out of the blue or is some app/someone spying on me and taking screenshots without me knowing which then prompted the message to show up? Appreciate your help. Thanks, Captain",1

"Android/Continue on PC/Link to Windows help please?  

This worked so well that I used in in lieu of Samsung Flow....until it doesn't. My phone is linked to my pc. I can send a tab from Edge or Firefox from my pc TO my Note10 without issue. However, every time I attempt the opposite, sending a tab from the Note to the pc, I get the spinning (looking for pc) thing and the ""get linked"" screen. I can text from my pc ""through"" the phone companion app, get my phones photos on the companion app on the pc, so it's obviously connected.

Samsung Flow however works so it's obviously not that the phone can't send the data....I've uninstalled, re-installed, cleared cache, checked for updates, etc. every thing I can think of.

"Do I have to take my phone to a service for water damage? My phone is a Xiaomi Redmi 5

To explain exactly, I dropped my phone in some water, basically just the upper part. I took it out quickly, wiped it up and (because I didn't know better) put it in rice overnight. That didn't do anything obviously, so after seeing it wasn't turning on this morning I opened up the back. I wiped the visible water with tissue paper and spent some time drying it with a hair dryer. I then left it open to air dry more for a few hours. When I could see no more condensation anywhere ( like on the lens of the front camera), I tried to turn it on again. 

It turned on fine, but there's an inch or so of water that got in a corner of the display area and it's visible.  I turned it back off, put it on its side on a tissue so the water would have somewhere to possibly come out. 

I asked a phone service out of curiosity if I did the right thing and they just said I should bring it ASAP - now, I don't know if it's cause of course they want to make money or just telling the truth. The cost of cleaning for liquid contact is pretty high and I'm not sure I can afford it right now.  So I'd like a few other opinions before I dish out the money I don't have :(",1

"Is there a way to add volume slider in the notification/control center panel? Is there a way to add a volume slider in the drop down menu?  I mean of course there are apps in playstore for that but if there is a convenient root solution possible for this that would be great.

The idea is simple. Like you swipe down, you bring down your notification/control center and at the bottom is a brightness slider, instead or just add an option for volume slider. Like in IOS control center. 

Now i can't use the typical iOS control center thing on my phone since I'm using OP6T android 10 oxygen os. Gesture based navigation (with swipe from left/right to go back)

I would always prefer a volume slider instead of a brightness slider or just an option to add two sliders.


The thing is, i hate using buttons, additionally i have a hard case on my phone so the buttons are hard to use.

I wish to operate my phone without any buttons, at all, i can open and close the screen, but there are times like i could adjust volume while listening to music, since Spotify doesn't provide that. 

This maybe a small thing for most people but this is exactly why i would've loved to use an iPhone 8 atleast. When you could easily access all your needs by swiping from bottom.

Its hard to imagine how everyone feels fine with this? No one genuinely cares about this? Especially those who have bad volume buttons or broken buttons. I hate to rely on buttons. This feels very, ancient. Especially when you have long phones, to reach the top with your finger in long phones is quite an inconvenience.

This is of course a very first world problem, but i guess in a world where people are trying to make everything as convenient as possible.. why not this?

(I do not wish to sound as a very rude person, if i do, i sincerely apologise, i guess i just feel a bit baffled about this omission in android when iOS users enjoy quite convenient and polished stuff like this)",1

"I'm hoping for advice on how to get into my Grandpa's phone since nobody knows the pin number. My Grandpa passed away last night. I'm with my Grandma and other family members. This is my first time dealing with something like this. She wants to be able to get into his phone to see the photos he has. I feel that getting her into the phone will help her a bit and I really want to help right now.

I have no idea how to get into the phone but the main thing my Grandma wants is the photos and to listen to the voicemails. 

The phone is a Galaxy A8. The IME is 354061094817834 if that helps. It needs a pin number with at least 4 digits.

All we have tried so far is random combinations of numbers that may have been important to him. I was watching youtube videos and one promising video showed deleting the password information from the system files but you needed custom recovery installed, which it wont have. He also does not have google recovery set up. 

Any suggestions would be great.

"How is Android device being rooted or running LineageOS different from PC running ordinary PC operating system (Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, OS X)? Hello everyone! Recently my friend told me about problems with apps (mainly banking apps, but also some other apps) -- some of them refuse to perform some operations (or refuse to work at all) on AOSP-based or rooted firmwares. Some of them just check for root, while others also check for custom firmware (like LineageOS). I'd like to note that it's not like VLC on desktop that can be compiled to refuse to run as root -- these apps refuse to run if the user isn't restricted enough on their own device.

Some people say that ""itsforsecurity"" -- but desktop operating systems give you root (or administrator in Windows) during the installation process. Why are desktop versions of these same applications that don't run on rooted mobile devices, don't care about root on desktop?

"Aspect ratio issues with Instagram stories (Samsung s10) Hello guys, I think reddit can help me out with this one.

Im an active Instagram user for my brand, and i really care about aesthetics and details, so since i changed from Iphone to the Samsung S10, ive been having aspect ratio compatibility issues, every time i try to upload a 9:16 (1080x1920) image to my stories, it gets cropped in because of the 19:9 aspect ratio of the Phone.

Its so hard to pinch the photo to get it to fit in the story, because sometimes you can see a line below or above the limits of the stories and its so annoying. 

The last solution i had was that after all this time, i switched to the max res of the phones display, and i actually had it work when ever i uploaded a 9:16 photo but only on my main account, the others still had the problem, and it reset for the main one once i restarted the phone. 

Does anyone have any solution at all?",1

"""Connected, no internet"" I have a Moto Z2 that is no longer in service (no mobile connection), but I use it to surf the web, watch videos, etc. while connected to wifi. Today, out of nowhere, I'm having trouble connecting to wifi. My other phone (the one that has phone service) isn't giving me trouble, so I think it's a problem with this specific device. I tried unplugging the modem and plugging it back in, but that didn't help. I tried restarting the phone, but that didn't help. I tried ""forgetting"" the wifi connection and then re-connecting, and that didn't help. I did a network settings reset, and that didn't help.Most of the time, the phone says ""Connected, no internet"". Sometimes it will switch to ""Connected"", but even then I can't use the internet (pages won't load, etc.). Sometimes I MIGHT be able to connect for like two seconds, but then it will stop working again.

"Galaxy S7 Edge - Instagram acting wonky Apologies if I should be posting this somewhere else, but I figured an Android sub would be the place to go.

For the past couple of weeks Instagram has been acting funky in that whenever I click on a story, post, view recent like activity on my account then nothing else seems to work. I first noticed that after viewing a story the entire top portion of app would be solid white instead of the camera icon 'Instagram' name and message icon.

"Play store downloads get stuck on my tablet. Already tried clearing data for Play Store, Download Manager, and Play Services. Maybe a month ago, Play Store app downloads (that is, updates) on my Huawei Mediapad M5 model SHT-W09 largely stopped completing. Each one that fails gets stuck at a specific percentage, which sometimes changes if I clear Download Manager data, and sometimes doesn't. The notification from Download Manager vanishes from the list at the moment the download freezes, which leads me to guess that it's crashing.

My list of pending updates just keeps growing because it's so hard to deal with.

There has not been a system update for around 6 months, so it doesn't make any sense for a system app to start crashing recently.

The tablet is very intentionally not rooted (if that's even possible), I bought it for the purpose of playing games I can't play on my rooted phone. 

Some things I have tried:

* Force stop the Play Store and re-launch it: Helps with downloads stuck at 100%, but not any at a lesser percentage.
* Stop and Clear data for the Play Store
* Stop and Clear data for the Download Manager: Sometimes helps, but not often enough. If I don't stop the Play Store this also brings up a ""can't download"" error, but that doesn't change anything.
* Stop and clear data for all three of Play Store, Download Manager, and Google Play Services, then reboot: Still happens.

So, Anyone got any ideas? I **really** don't want to factory reset, since unrooted Android has no functional way to backup my apps and their data.

"how to automate or silently configure device? Hallo,

I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results.

I'd like to do some configuration after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file.

It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended, and I'd like to do the same for my family's smartphones. Android does this - to an extent - by offering to restore from a previous device setup, but this option leaves out the most (for me) tedious task: setting up multiple email accounts.

What I mean is setting up the account, WiFi, and some more like setting some particular config items for the keyboard, display, notifications, ringtones, some privacy settings, more email accounts.

I tried Google Business G Suite but (to my understanding) explicitly says it does not push sensitive information like passwords - but that's exactly what I'd want to do - fully configure email accounts including pop/imap/ssl/smtp/password settings.

Is this feasible? When searching the web I find a lot of automation tools but for operating, not for setting up.

Thanks &amp; stay healthy,

"Huawei digital balance - android alternative Hi r/AndroidQuestions!

I'm hoping for some recommendations or suggestions here, been out of the loop with android developments and fed up with searching, downloading, been disappointed and unistalling apps!

I've got the P30, love it. Best camera I've had and the device runs well. Won't be upgrading to another Huawei without Google play though. One of the features I like most is the digital balance, the breakdown it gives me and options to restrict usage of apps to keep myself in check is fantastic.

"Trouble installing Play Store on ex-corporate tablet I scored for 30 bucks an [Exertis SMB-H8005](https://sg.carousell.com/p/android-exertis-smb-h8005-16gb-239668813/) 8"" tablet running Nougat with 2 gigs of RAM. I'm not sure if it's a generic Chinese product or a specific OEM; it comes with [MobiControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.soti.mobicontrol.androidwork&amp;hl=en), apparently some kind of corporate access application, and that makes me think it was originally intended for staff use at some office or something and might have been purpose-designed (or at least purpose-configured out of the factory).

It would appear to be new old-stock as it still has the factory protector on the screen and no scratches whatsoever.

It comes with a few basic application, but the Play Store is not present. This is a situation I've found myself in before, and what I usually do is go to APKMirror and download the latest Play Store APK as well as the latest Google Play Services. Once both are installed it usually works.

Not this time, though - I just get the ""sign in"" button that doesn't work and a three-dots menu that gets me in a very sparse settings menu if I click ""settings"" and crashes the play store if I click ""updates"".

This isn't going to be some hacky performance machine, just a light-duty tab for watching films and occasional light Internet use, so worse comes to worst I can just sideload everything off of APKmirror - but that way I wouldn't get any updates unless I downloaded everything manually every time, which I can *not* be arsed doing.

Any idea on what I can try to get the Play Store to work?

"Chrome says I downloaded something that I certainly did not and it's not anywhere I look System Info: 
LG Stylo (1st Gen) (LG-H631) 
Android 6.0 
Kernel 3.10.49 
Build MRA58K 
Security Patch 2017-03-01 
Software Version H63120o 
Chrome v83.0.4103.96 
T-Mobile 

(Apologies for the formatting. I am on mobile)

So, not gonna lie, I was browsing a rather sketchy video site in chrome. No, it wasnt PornHub. It was a """"""Free"""""" video site where you could watch and download pretty much any kind of video from any website or streaming platform (YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, ~~OnlyFans,~~ HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Snapchat, etc. etc.)

As I was browsing, this download prompt from Chrome popped up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"". I already know that Flash doesn't have an Android app nor does Android does need an app for viewing flash content. So, I basically said ""FOH"" and clicked cancel. A short while later, another download prompt showed up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk"" as ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" already existed.

Obviously, I clicked cancel again, closed the site, backed out of Chrome entirely and began searching through my files. There was nothing in my downloads folder that was named ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" at all. There were, however, three randomly named ""part"" files in there which were created literally a minute before I started looking through my files (according to the details at least).

So I deleted the three part files and, to be on the safe side, I decided to revist the site to see if I could retrigger the download prompt. I know, that was probably stupid, but again, there was no ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" in my files, only the three last files. I figured that if it came again asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" then I'd know I got rid of it by deleting the part files.

But, when I went to the site again, the download prompt came up asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk."" instead. I NOOOOPED out of that again, closed the site, closed Chrome, and forced stopped Chrome.

So here is where my problem comes in.

I checked my downloads folder again and it's completely empty. I enabled ""Show Hidden Files"" and nothing comes up. I went and searched through the Chrome app data on both my phone and my SD Card and still nothing.

I opened up Chrome again and checked the download history and strangely enough, there was a ongoing download for ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" that I most certainly did NOT agree to. Chrome said that it was ""downloading"" the file and had downloaded 11.8MB out of 11.8MB. It seemed to be stuck trying to finish downloading the file, however. I watched it for like 30 seconds and it never seemed to finish. It also had the broken thumbnail icon next to it that (at least from what I've seen) comes up when Chrome tries and fails to download something or the file it downloaded is no longer in the folder Chrome downloaded it into.

There was an X next to the download that I clicked on to cancel the download, which it did, thankfully but it also just removed it from the list without telling me where it was downloading from or to.

I get that I'm probably, for all intents and purposes, fine since it looks like I interrupted it mid-download but I NEVER agreed to download this thing (Chrome didn't even let me know it was downloading the file) and that has me concerned.

What else can I do to make sure that this thing is legit gone?",1

"Android OS architecture/APK Question Good afternoon everyone. 

I have been wracking my brain over this for two days now, and I've decided to just ask the question.

Could someone explain the difference in the ""32-bit mode on a 64 bit OS"", and just a 64 bit android OS?

I have a TCL Smart TV with AndroidTV 9 and with built-in DVB-S2/T card, everything works as was mentioned but the native app to manage my satellite/antenna channels sucks and you can't personalize on it. I did some research and I found this company named TARA Systems and they developed this really powerful App called LiveOn TV to manage your channels and with a really cool UI and much more stuff but unfortunately I didn't find a way to download it because they only work with OEMs.

Question 1: Is there any other app that can do the trick like this LiveOn TV app?

Question 2: If you have a link to download the original LiveOn TV app from TARA Systems or you know how to purchase it or something please don't hesitate to tell me.

Most of the apps on google play store work fine. But some don't. I want to use the tablet lust for my security cams. For this, I need a software called EZVIZ. It is in the play store.

"My speaker doesn’t work anymore !! I was listening to music, casually, volume all the way up, then suddenly the volume drops down and sounds kinda muffled, when I got to the phone, I noticed that the bottom speaker doesn’t work anymore, the sound only comes out of the earpiece, I have an iPhone 8.

Here are the things I tried: blowing air into the speaker, shaking it a little bit (It may be dumb but you never know), apple’s recommendations, water eject although it hadn’t been anywhere near water (that reminds me I had resorted to this around 2 months ago, some water had gotten into one of the speakers, or maybe both, but I eventually got it out (which again reminds me, I think around that same time I experienced something similar, only then I was on Instagram, got the phone to my ear to listen to an audio, and it was stuck on outputting from the earpiece, it worked fine after a simple reboot) I don’t know if any of this is relevant), making a call on speaker works but only through the top speaker, plugging and unplugging headphones, on and off Bluetooth, rebooting, reset settings, and only then did I remember hard reboot was an option, and since it still didn’t work, I tried it too. Finally I tried cleaning up the lightning port and the speaker grill with a sharpened q-tip, although there wasn’t much to clean.

I think the next step is to factory reset, but I’d like to see if there’s anything else I can do.

I saw a video somewhere where they had a similar issue and fixed it by deleting an app that “controls the speakers”, I haven’t installed any new app, is there a way to see which apps do that?, but I guess if that was the case resetting settings should’ve solved it?

Could you help me figure out what could’ve happened? I didn’t really drop it that day (yesterday, this happened ~18h ago), didn’t get no shock or any particular damage. It just happened out of nowhere. Could it be that something disconnected? How? Why? Or maybe the speaker is just dead and needs to be replaced ?

"iPhone 7 Passcode Change issue So this support issue is about my sibling's iPhone's password changing.  (iPhone 7, bought around 2017 i think, in the Philippines if that helps)

Apparently, while the code was verifying for quite a while, my other sibling suggests to them that they should turn the iPhone off (not shut it down completely). Now while this appears to work, the phone says it requires a 6 digit code or touch ID, but when we try to unlock the phone with the original 6 digits, it doesn't work.

"Dropped iPhone 6 and won't turn back on; battery is ok; must be hardware failure? To summarize this:

- Dropped it a day or two ago and won't turn back on, usually when this happened I could fix it by charging it and it will force to turn on. What happened when I did that was it shows the Apple logo and it would turn off again and stuck in that loop.

- Took it for repair and learned that the battery was ok and the phone most likely needed a factory reset, took them an hour to no avail but assured that it could be fixed though I took the phone anyway and went home.

- Tried iTunes and Fonepaw, usually when the recovery is about the start, the phone restarts (when in recovery mode) and then the Apple logo with the loading will show up (based on videos I've watched). This doesn't happened on me and it would just go back to recovery mode and iTunes and Fonepaw would show me error.

When I replace the battery I'll ask them to check the proximity sensor too, maybe the ebay seller changed the screen before selling and damaged something in there, no idea. But how come the sensor's red light is there when it's not working?

"What's the appeal of wireless charging for iPhones? I have an iPhone XS and I recently picked up an Anker Powerwave pad to try out wireless charging.  So far, I'm not sure I totally understand the appeal of it.

Wireless charging:
- is slower than a high amperage lightning connection (USB Power Delivery)
- requires a more precise positioning than a wired connection (several times I've woken up in the morning with an uncharged phone, having accidentally nudged it off the pad in my sleep)
- prevents the use of other useful rear-mounted phone accessories like magnet car mounts and Pop Sockets
- doesn't continue to charge while you are using the phone (since you've lifted it up from the charging pad)

The only upsides that I can see is that you reduce the daily wear &amp; tear on the lighting port, and that placing it on a pad is somewhat faster and more convenient than reaching for a cable and plugging it in.

I'd love to embrace a wonderful future without wires, but I don't really see the upsides right now.  Am I missing something?",0

Iphone 11 Pro, current iOs version

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**
So im in a semi long distance relationship, 2 hours away, and my significant other and I enjoy video chatting each other when im not close by. She has an Android Samsung Galaxy S10. When we first started video chatting, I had an Iphone X and we used Whatsapp messenger for our video calls. We had ZERO issues when it came to her hearing me and I hearing her. Sometimes I would just regular facetime her work phone which is an iPHone X as well, and everything worked.

My Iphone X shit the bed, and I had to upgrade. I got an Iphone 11 pro. Since day ONE, facebook messenger, facetime app, and whatsapp ALL have ""hearing"" issues. What I mean by this is, the video works fine on both wifi and cellular data. However, 75% of the time, she only hears every other word or sometimes even every 4th or 5th word. Its bad. To the point that we dont video chat much anymore because theres no point due to she cant get what im saying.

Please, there HAS to be a solution. I called Verizon Wireless and because of COVID, they were not much help and told me to basically restart my device and do all that basic stuff. This is not a restart my phone and its fixed type of issue.

"Did I change a setting to make my screen wake when I pick it up? Where’s the setting? IPhone 7 on latest iOS. Recently my phone has been waking the screen when I pick it up.  It happened since updating to the newest iOS.  How do I turn it off?  I can’t find the setting.  I can replicate it by lifting the phone and turning it.  


Note:   At the same time I updated the iOS, I installed a new battery, which sent me down a rabbit hole of additional problems.  The vibrate is very wonky.  It hits very hard and for calls or texts or anything for that matter, it only vibrates for like a tenth of a second and then stops.  It also vibrates for different functions like toggle settings, which I don’t think it did before.  I’ve even found a setting that says disable all vibration on this device, and even when enabled, I still get vibrations.  I’ve tried disabling haptic and 3D touches.  Still get vibrations.   I think this is unrelated to my original question, I’m just providing it to be thorough and describe that it was both the battery upgrade and iOS update that my problem with the screen began.   I’ve also replaced the Taptic Engine and it did not solve my vibrate issue, so I think that could be a bigger issue.

"iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful.  

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*iPhone 8 Plus running 13.5.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

2 years ago, US, AT&amp;T store. Currently on a monthly family plan with AT&amp;T. Other 2 iPhones (X, and 7 Plus) have no issues.

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

This is my daughter's phone so it's hard to know for sure when it started or why.. She mentioned continuously getting prompted for iCloud password and also that it wasn't working (but not sure she knows it for sure). She also mentioned something about a number she didn't recognize when she tried to reset her password for iCloud.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I have tried pretty much everything I found on the internet..

* Reset Network Settings
* Reboot iPhone
* Disabled iMessage, FaceTime, signed out of iCloud, waited over night, signed in to iCloud, tried to activate iMessage and it failed.
* Erased phone and restored from backup
* Tried just on LTE, just on WIFI
* Reseated the SIM card

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

What's weird is when you go into Settings &gt; Messages and you hit the ""Send &amp; Receive"" under iMessage.. On mine it shows my apple id at the top, grayed out, then under ""You can receive imessages to and reply from"" it has my phone number (grayed out), my icloud account, and my gmail account.. It has a check mark by all of them

On hers, under the you can receive she has her phone number and her [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) account.. Only the icloud account has a checkmark.. When you try to select her phone number it spins for about 3 seconds and then nothing happens..  No checkmark.. 

Not sure what else to try..

"Pretty sure my iPhone X officially died tonight... is there any way to get my info off of it? 1. iPhone X running what I’m guessing is the newest iOS as I update it routinely.

2. I think I purchased the phone in February 2018 so warranty is long gone.

3. So today at the pool I was taking pictures of my boyfriend and baby in the water and I got it wet briefly. I didn’t really think of it as a big deal because I’ve definitely had it in the water the first summer I had it and taken pictures. But then all of a sudden the screen turned off. I didn’t think much about it because the apple comes up on the screen. 

So when we get inside from the pool the screen has the apple comes up and will go back off &amp; then I got the support.apple.com/iPhone/restore screen. I hard restarted it &amp; it came up again, but then when I plug it into my laptop iTunes doesn’t recognize it as being plugged in so I can’t restore it. I just went ahead and ordered a new phone to be picked up tomorrow because my phone is critical for work. I’m guessing that my X is completely toast &amp; I have it set to backup to iCloud but I can’t really figure out how to tell when the last update was? I’m assuming everything that I did on my phone today is gone (including the photos from the first time my baby went swimming which I’m now an emotional mother about) but how can I tell when my last back up actually was? 

Face ID stopped working about maybe a year or so ago, I attributed that to my having dropped the phone quite a lot (thank god for a strong case!) and knocked something out of whack. I’m guessing when it got wet this time it just ruined something and it doesn’t want to work now.

I haven’t tried anything other than hard restarting the phone twice (put it in a bag of rice now, but the phone actually seems to be turning on if the apple is showing up??) and plugging it into my laptop but that’s all. I’m open to any information about how to possibly get the phone restored so I can continue use, or how to pull any pictures from today off of it possibly. I guess I’ll finally start uploading my photos to the cloud - this is what I get for not doing it!

"How to put iPhone 4 in Recovery or DFU mode with no home button I have an old iPhone 4s that I'm trying to reset. The home button is broken and the PIN/password is forgotten.

The normal way to factory reset an iPhone 4 is to hold the home and power button down, but the home button is broken so I have to find another way.

But those apps did not work because reiboot couldn't do it without me entering the PIN, and recboot only works in a 32 bit OS (Mine is 64 bit Windows).

"Can I Hide or Block the Voice Memos app? Our young daughter has voice memos on her iPad and she is over the top obsessed with yelling and screaming at it to see how the bars change with her voice. At first, it was cute how interested she was in seeing how her voice changes the sound waves, but now it’s our least favorite thing. We let her use her iPad twice a day- in the early morning when she gets up before us, and for an hour during the day for “quiet rest time.”  (Yes, she has other toys and things to do... she mostly uses it to play a couple little SagoMini games... parental controls are on...) We have told her to stop yelling at it, and she will... until she remembers she has the app and starts doing it again. 

It’s gotten to the point where she uses it so much that not only is it driving us insane, her “memos” are taking up all the space on her iPad.  She has well over 1000 recordings and sometimes just doesn’t hit the end recording button so she’ll have 7 hours of just random talking throughout the day. 

I want to hide it or put some parental controls on to say she can use it for 15 minutes a day or something. Just ANYTHING. Google is no help, this is my next stop before contacting Apple.",0

"Error 14'd, can I restore and then restore from backup from iOS 13.5? Hey all. Here's what happened. My phone said it was full. ""Other"" was 10gb. I deleted some pics. Still full. Other was now 13gb. I deleted 400 pics, 5 huge chat threads, 8 100mb+ apps. Other was 18gb. 

I was going to back up and reset my phone. I was trying to back it up and it kept saying ""iPhone disconnected"". So I thought, ill restart it. I did, and it didn't boot. Just stuck on apple logo. I then tried to ""Update"" through recovery mode on my Mac with Catalina. Error 14. 

Tried USBC to lightning directly to my Mac, different ports, using the IPSW, etc. Ive error 14'd probably 10 times at least. So I decided I would restore from an old back up. 

I realize that if I restore my phone in recovery mode with finder, it will update to 13.5.1. Does this mean my backup is useless? Cause once its restored it will be 13.5.1, so I dont think I can restore from my back up from last month using 13.5?

"What is taking up all my phone space? So the other day I deleted over 3000 photos and 10 minutes worth of video because my phone storage was full.

The problem is that it's two days later and my phone storage is full again, but I haven't done anything. I haven't downloaded any videos or saved that many pictures.

"One contact, can't get texts and calling goes to voicemail - contact not blocked My friend's (let's call them Friend A) iphone SE has an issue where they can't get texts from a specific contact (Friend B). When A texts B, it looks like the text is going through fine from the point of view of A, and if A tries to call B, it goes straight to voicemail. 


I tried walking A through checking to see if B is blocked, and the B is not blocked on their phone, nor on their Verizon account. 


Does the text and voicemail situation indicate B could have their number blocked by mistake? We've all talked about it and B says it isn't the case, nor would it be intended.


Could it be a bug of some kind? Any search results point to a blocked contact, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here. I could walk A through a factory reset and logging back in, but don't want to do that if it isn't necessary or wouldn't possibly make a difference (geography of all three of us being apart and technological literacy).

"Front glass shatter = unable to unlock with passcode, or drag down Control Center Hey all, I have an iPhone X that I love. The glass on the front got broken where the top third of the display doesn't seem to register human touch. This is a problem because the 2 and 3 don't work in the dialpad when trying to unlock my iphone. 

I have one of those female USB-to-lightning adapters the try to hit it with my PC keyboard, but the iPhone reads this as an Accessory that needs to be unlocked to work.

Apple stores are closed, a call to the support line didn't yield much, and Best Buy was only able to tell me about replacement options. I have some photos I'd like to grab but I didn't sync my photostream with iCloud previously.

The camera app is currently grayed out, meaning the phone must have restarted once. That might be a blow to some solutions (like my adapter detailed below).

1 - is there a method to get the passcode entered that I have not thought of yet? I'm willing to scrape off glass if needed to hit the numbers in mechanically. I also tried to use screen mirroring with Reflector software but I can't drag down the Control Center because the top third of the screen is kaput, meaning no ability to Mirror.

2 - If not 1, is there a way I can remotely grab my Photostream through icloud with the device locked?

"Problems detaching disabled App Store account from iPhone? Hey guys I hope someone here can help me out. Long story short my  iTunes/App Store account that I’ve used since 2008 has been disabled. I never got a reason why but I’m sure I know.

So it sucks my account is disabled but whatever. I then took it off my iPhone and removed it from my cloud etc. I made a brand new iTunes/App Store account but when I went to install something I got the same message about my account being disabled.

"Iphone 6S ...my GF has is driving me crazy! My girlfriend ( she is 49 so that term seems strange not that I write it here...) she has an Iphone 6S and 75% of the time when I am talking to her every third word or so goes digital ( thats what I call it...sounds like a muffled robot?) and yet she can here me perfectly. 

I have a Samsung S8 and have no problems talking to anyone except her. 

Her kids also live in the home and have Iphone 10's and have no issue when taking to me or anyone else , so I am strongly leaning towards replacing her phone. She primarily uses it for voice calls, texting and a bit of social media and is not a tech kinda girl.

"Help with Google photos + New iPhone Hi friends. I just upgraded to the iPhone 11. I haven’t restored my backup from my old device to it yet because I sort of don’t want allllll the shit from my old phone on my new one - I want a fresh start! But I have a question regarding my photos. 

I use google photos and all my iPhone pictures are backed up there. Is it safe for me to delete all my iPhone photos on my old device, so that when I sign into iCloud on my new device, they aren’t downloaded onto my new phone? And then maybe I don’t even need to restore the old back up, I can just start fresh and re-download my apps manually? 

I know nothing of how this stuff works so I’m not sure if that’s a dumb idea or not. But like I said, I just want a fresh start on my iPhone so that’s what I’m attempting. Is there anything I should know about choosing not to restore my back up that could make this a bad idea?

"Some songs don't appear on my iphone music library Im a complete newbie to iphones, only used to own android phones. So what I wanted to do was transfer the music I have on my computer to my iphone 11. I read on their website the tutorial to do this and did the following:

1)Downloaded itunes

2)Drag and dropped all the songs I wanted to transfer to the itunes library

3)Connected iphone to computer via usb

4)Clicked on the phone icon on itunes, which led me to a page with all the info of my iphone

5)Clicked apply/synch

6)It apparently did its thing and finished synching all songs (apparently, because it had a loading bar saying ""transferred 200 out of 200 songs"" which is the real total amount of songs I had)

But when I go check the list of songs the iphone has, both on the itunes and on the music app on the phone, there have been some that successfully transferred,but also many many songs that are missing.

I dont know what went wrong. Is it because Im not subscribed to apple music? Or maybe because the audio is in mp3 (havent proven this theory, didnt have the time to check what type of file the missing songs are. But between the 200 songs theres a mix of both mp3 and aac.)

It is only painfully slow on my home wifi. Everywhere else it works great! My friends network even works fine and we have the same isp. Could it just be a compatibility issue? Is it my router?

"My Iphone 8 dies for a couple of days up to a week when I'm close to a welding machine, I'd love to know why. 1. iPhone model and iOS version

I'm not very interested in phones or up to date with models and releases but I'm pretty sure it's an Iphone 8 plus and it probably has the most up to date iOS

2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

It's my work phone, I didn't buy it. I live in Sweden but this has so far only happened to me and my colleagues while working on a project in Germany.

3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

Today I saw it happen in front of my eyes, I pulled up my phone to take a picture and as I was about to snap the picture the screen just started showing thin white vertical lines on a grey background, the screen became brighter and brighter for thirty seconds until it went all black. It reacts to no buttons, nothing happens when I put in the charger, when I ask someone to call me it's like it's turned off. But last time it happened to me and to most of my colleagues, it will just start working in a couple of days again.

It occurs when we weld. At a certain stage of my job we have a 10 hour shift where we TIG-weld copper. It is somehow related to that because it always happen during that shift but while I'm annoyed I'm dying to know the exact cause. We only have DC in our TIG torches when welding copper. It's a fairly powerful welding machine able to output upwards 450 Ampere required for copper welding.

4. What caused the issue?

I'm not sure about the exact cause. Today when it happened the welding machine was turned on standing maybe 1,5 meters away but noone was running it since maybe 30 minutes. 

5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

Me and my colleagues try to not wear the phones in our pockets while we weld. We need to be able to take photos and to be reached, so I still kept them around, so I guess at this point a solution to have it not happen in the future is to keep the phone in another building as we do this but that's annoying.

6. Any other information you think might be useful.

We think it's only these newer Iphones it's happening to. But it also only happens when we're in Germany. Maybe that's all a coincidence but it's just so weird. I moved the SIM-card to another, older Samsung phone, and it's working fine. Maybe it's relevant, the item we weld is high voltage DC conductors for power transmission.

Does anyone have any ideas what it might be doing this, or how I could get my phone to start working again right away?",0

"iPhone 7 Says “No Service” ?? Hello! I would truly appreciate some help with this situation i’m in right now. So my phone is 4-ish years old iPhone 7, and it’s never given me a problem until recently. I would wake up some mornings starting around a month ago and a notification would pop up that said “cellular update failed”. I wasn’t even aware of what a cellular update was or that it was happening. It would not allow me to use cellular data at all. The only solutions to this were to update the phone or do a hard reset. It would be fixed immediately, if not by the next morning. These methods have been working for a few weeks, but last night and all day today it has said No Service all the time no matter what, and that in order to use cellular data on this iPhone, I have to update, but I can’t because it’s up to date at 13.5.1. I don’t know why this is happening or what to do now, can anyone please help? Thank you!",0

I tried restarting settings, clearing out as many caches as I can, deleting old files and voice memos, but I could only reduce my storage to 61 gb.

"iPhone XR Texting Freeze My iPhone XR will sporadically freeze and crash while texting within the Messages app. It seems to be worse in the evening, when I have used it throughout the day. It is limited to texting pretty much only, but I have experienced issues with streaming music on cellular data (using Spotify specifically). I have the most recent version of iOS  (13.5.1) and have had this issue through the last two versions.  


Troubleshooting done with no solution:  
Verified no storage issues (128 gb iPhone with 50+ gigs left)

Turned off background app refresh

Used Apple brand chargers and wall adapters

Removed and reinstalled a multitude of apps

Reset iPhone and restored from backup

Restored iPhone straight from backup (trying to avoid starting all over again)

Turned off push notifications for email and other apps  


The iPhone is in relatively good shape and has been dropped a handful of times with a case. 

Has anyone else experienced an issue like this? It is ONLY with the Messages app, and once it starts freezing, it pretty much will not stop and texting becomes impossible. A restart has no affect on the freezes and crashing. Before I go through the effort of calling Apple or doing anything further, is there a fix for this? Anything else I can try?

The phone is under warranty, but I am not sure if Apple will do anything for an issue like this.",0

"iPhone 11 screen problem Hello this is an iPhone 11, which I had bought over 7months ago, I've been gaming on it on and off ever since March and I have been left with those pesky smudges which never go away, no matter how much I wipe using water and/or a soft cloth.

This is how it looks when I wipe it with some water

the partial area somehow appear to be hydrophilic? now. I mean water slides off easily from the other parts of the screen like it should however it simply stays on those spots as if something that had once been there repelling water is not there anymore? I'm not sure at all.

"I got locked out of my iPhone 8+ Hi everyone.

Two days ago, my iPhone of nearly 2 years stopped functioning normally. None of my alarms rang that morning - I couldn't click on anything. I restarted my phone a couple of times only to be stuck at the Apple logo for hours. 

I did a hard reset and plugged my phone into my laptop to get it into recovery mode. I had it install an update, but my laptop suddenly went on sleep mode and lost all its progress. I was left with no choice but to restore my phone. And I did. 

After restoring, my phone prompts a message to say about 'remote management' and that a certain company (I won't name) has control over my phone. An apple tech guy also walked me through recovery mode, but we got the same result. His hunch is that this phone used to belong to that company and only decided to lock it now (and that he'll help me escalate this problem next week, but that my homework is to contact the company). I restored my phone 4 times in total that day. 

Let's just say I wasn't received with warmth by the company, and they may not be the solution to my problem. I contacted the seller too, who was happy to reply and escalate to his supplier (he has 100% rating on eBay, and I was sure at least then that I bought this phone brand new - I even checked it with my serial ID and it says I have a valid purchase date). He said he'll keep me posted. 

I guess at this point, I'm trying to think about my options (buying a new phone being the very last resort). Is there any way I can go around this, or is my iPhone useless now? (I'm located in Australia, if that's of any help warranty-wise). 

Thanks in advance.",0

"Intermittent cell signal loss. Apple blames carrier. Carrier blames Apple. Frustrated. **Summary of issue:** Several times per day, my iPhone 11 Pro will suddenly completely lose cell service. It’ll go from 4 bars to 0 bars, during which time I can’t place calls or use cellular data. This happens in several different geographic locations so it’s not a signal issue. Furthermore, my work phone uses the same carrier and doesn’t have these issues. After a minute or two, the service returns and it works like usual. 

**What I’ve done to try to fix it:** My first move was to call Apple since I have AppleCare+. Apple had me take several troubleshooting steps including checking for Carrier Setting Updates, Resetting Network Settings, and erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. None of these solutions fixed my problem. 

Next, they had me call my carrier (FirstNet, which uses AT&amp;T towers). My carrier reprovisioned the phone, and then sent me a physical SIM card to replace the eSIM which I had been using. Neither of these fixed the issue. 

Back to Apple, who me install a profile to collect more detailed Baseband logs. Engineers at Apple still blame my carrier based on the logs. 

I’ve been having this problem for over a month now. I told Apple I’d like a new phone since I think it’s pretty clearly a hardware issue. They warned me repeatedly that I’d be charged the full retail price of the phone if they aren’t able to replicate the issue. This issue is so infrequent that I seriously worry they won’t be able to reproduce the issue and I’ll be screwed out of $1,000.

"iPhone 7 recover photos/videos after Reset procedure possible? Hi,

I consider myself tech-oriented, have a lot of experience with tech gear, software, computers etc. Just to clear that line out.

Now, I don't personally use iPhone, my colleagues and friends around me do and I have limited experience, e.g. performed setup and registrations for friends in the past, installed few apps and so on.

And one important friend just had a **weird accident with her iPhone 7**. The internal memory was full, she cleared few old photos and videos to make some room for new ones, and decided to **restart (reboot)** the phone to see if it will make it run smoother.

And that's when the problem occurred. The phone shown a message that it is now **locked and to connect to iTunes to unlock it**. That message does not happen unless you make a mistake **10 times to try to unlock it (brute force protection)**, but she **denies** that that ever happened. It's her own phone, not stolen one obviously, and she **never changed her password** in the last 3 (or 4?) years.

Anyhow, she gave me the phone to try recover it, since her laptop is some ancient one on Win 7 and iTunes no longer works properly there (phone requires newer version).

I installed iTunes on my Win 10 laptop, everything went fine, phone was started in recovery mode, but during the ""update"" recovery procedure (non-destructive) phone stopped the update process, and iTunes reported that it cannot be updated because of an unknown error.

Ok, next thing, the only thing left, really, was factory reset via iTunes, I entered all the Apple ID and unlock pin credentials, and it was done.

**Phone is now factory clean. And it works 100% fine. But it is empty :(**

\*\*\* She DOES NOT have: \*\*\*

**1) any iTunes backups**

**2) iCloud or other cloud backups (iCloud was off)**

**Is there a \*\*\*beeping\*\*\* way to recover some photos and videos from her phone?**

AppStore is useless (US country), when I enter ""**photo recovery**"" in search, I get the whole crap apps in there. I'm all Android, at least we have **DiskDigger** and tons of other options (in particular, if we have external memory card storage).

Any, and I really mean, any app for Windows that advertises like crazy on Google for iPhone recovery is useless, since they either find no photos at all, just calendar and similar things (unimportant) or require **iTunes/iCloud backup** something. I have tried at least 10 of them, and traditional apps like Recuva and alike do not see iPhone as a storage device, since it's mounted like a media something crap (MTP device).

Sorry for the long post, but my Saturday is ruined anyway, and is there any way that really works?

I got an idea to use **iExplorer** to mount it as a **FAT32 Windows drive**, and it was like hell hard to find a matching iTunes version that will work with iExplorer properly, but it was a no go, either. Software like **Recuva** complained about unrecognized file system, and **Stellar Phoenix** *something* successfully scanned it (in like 5-6 minutes, which was odd), but didn't find a thing. It's a virtual device driver that goes through iTunes, so it was a long shot anyway, but still... pity.

I can run a **Linux Ubuntu** disk, but not sure how the device is going to be mounted there and what recovery apps options are available. Does anyone have any idea in this regard?

Any idea?

"iPhone X won’t start up. Stuck on Apple logo. Hello, I am looking for some help with my girlfriends iPhone X. 

First let me give you the details,

It’s an iPhone X, not sure on the firmware. I think it was 13.3. I bought it from my friend second hand for her but there weren’t any issues other than the back glass being smashed. Haven’t had any other issues with the phone until today. Hasn’t been dropped, no water damage and haven’t tried to update it and anything happen midway through so I’m at a loss to the problem. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning to her phone not turning on after being on charge overnight. I have tried the hard reset as well as recovery mode and dfu mode but her mac doesn’t recognise the phone when it is plugged in but it recognises mine so the problem lies with the phone not anything else. 

When plugging into the wall to charge it gives the battery charging indication and then starts to boot up with the Apple logo but won’t go past that. It will sit on this screen forever.

Basically I’m just wondering if anyone experienced this or has any advice of what to do next. 

I spoke to Apple support but they only told me everything I already knew then gave me a quote of £600+ to fix it which is ridiculous when I only paid £100 for the phone. 

If there is nothing I can do then she’ll just get a new phone but if it’s possible to fix it I wanna give it a go.

I did sign into my outlook email on mail, and it’s also the email I had on the old Apple ID that would have had these contacts saved to it, does anyone know if this is a reason? Or have apple somehow confused my accounts",0
"Followup to Earlier post - iPhone 7 won't turn on  

I have an iphone 7, it finally gave up last week, wouldn’t turn on anymore. I tried DFU and the phone died in the middle of the process.

Upon recommendations from this page, I ordered a new battery. I've repaired phones in the past so I had a good idea of what I was doing.

Installed new battery today, after about an hour’s charge, I plugged it into iTunes, where the DFU process worked as expected. I downloaded a whole software update but now the phone won’t turn on at all, won’t respond to hard reset or DFU. What’s going on?

Do I need to wait for the battery to fully charge maybe?",0
"SE2 on iOS 13.5 has a strong wifi connection, fast internet speed test of 450 Mbps, but use of the internet browser and social media are VERY slow. What might be the problem? I run the Speed Test in my phone to see that it is apparently receiving 450 Mbps in download internet speed.

Why might the internet very slow?  For example, when browsing social media like Instagram, it often won’t load pages or comments. I’ll have to exit and then re-enter those pages.

"iOS / iPhone Xs file sharing limitations?  

Hi,

I recently purchased a iPhone Xs after owning an Android phone for several years.

It's been a long time since I last owned an iOS phone and I forgot that unlike Android, iOS has a lot of limitations on what files you can access on the phone.

I am currently using iTunes and the File Sharing option to try to access files and while I can see a list of file sharing apps as well as the root directory for each file sharing app...I am not able to drill down and open any of the folders/sub directories to add or copy files inside of the folders.

I can however add or copy files and folders on the root level.

Why does Apple allow access to the root directory for each file sharing app to add or copy files or folders but then restricts us from opening the folders in order to add or copy files inside of the folders?

Kind regards,

Drew",0
"Fried iphone xs due to water? Yesterday i came home and wanted to clean my iphone xs, i used some alcohol on the screen and case, which I guess could've entered the charging ports and other holes. I also rinsed it under water for around 10 secs.

"iPhone main camera won’t work &amp; deleting pictures in selfie mode Hi! I’ve been having this problem for a few months now and it’s gotten to the point where I wanna smash this thing because I need to take pictures for work, so I appreciate all the help I can get! 

Okay info, I read the rules about info and I think I have everything but sorry if it’s not perfect! I have an iPhone 8 running a 13.5 iOS. I have one update available but I don’t have WiFi at my house so I always update my phone at my dads. Sometimes it takes a while for me to update the phone and I’ll miss some of the updates, but that’s normal and I’ve always done that with my iPhones. The problem started a few months ago and I’ve done two big iOS downloads since (that skipped some of the downloads) and the first download remedied my problem for like 3 days then it didn’t work again &amp; the next download didn’t help at all with the camera. 

The problem is that my main camera is completely black, no image, no sounds, can’t take a picture, can’t take a video, can’t use my flashlight. I’ve tried the camera when my phone was both locked and opened &amp; in other camera apps like Snapchat. My selfie camera does show images and I can take a picture most of the time like that, but it often will take a few pictures, freeze up the frame and then “refresh” itself but the pictures are gone. I’ve tried most of the random things you can find on google like turn it off and back on and delete this and reinstall etc. Of course I would love an easy magic solution to fix this without taking it somewhere but I’ll do it if I have to. 

Thanks in advance to any and all help, much love!",0

"Iphone 7 ""cellular update failed"" bug - 2 different phones? Hi There, post addresses: 

\-Iphone 7, 128gig,  running IOS 13.5 (up to date) 

\- purchased 1 week ago via Amazon in the U.S.

First I should address I am aware of the bug causing the ""cellular update failed"" on some iPhone 7's specifically. Makes the phone think it has no service etc. I know you can (or could?) return to Apple for a fix.

My original iPhone 7 (which I had for many years) NEVER had this problem. I just had dropped it, broken the camera, drained the battery, etc and it was time to replace. I'm broke AF at the moment and wanted to go for a cheaper refurb option. So I got the same iPhone 7 with the same specs but refurbished from BestBuy. One day in had this problem. Returned it - bought another one from Amazon. Again, it had this problem but except this time on and off sometimes for days at a time. 

THE QUESTION IS: is there any world where two separate model# iPhone 7's have this issue - or could this be a problem with my AT&amp;T account or my sim card (the only common denominator between the 3 phones). I know a refurb is a sketchy option but I just don't want to spend the cash on a new phone - especially if this can be fixed. Again, the original iPhone7 with the same sim card NEVER had this problem.

"""New"" iPhone X Won't Activate My brother gave me his old iPhone today as a graduation present. It's an iPhone X, and the one I currently use is an iPhone 7. I've been trying all night to set up and activate the new phone, but it won't work. I connected it to my computer, but it kept telling me to connect to a computer even though I already was, or it would say that I am indeed connected to a computer, but do nothing else. 

Many, many times it had me enter in my Apple ID and password, load for a bit, and not do anything. On my computer, in the iTunes app, I located the device on there because it was plugged into the computer, and it also kept having me enter in my Apple ID login info over and over again. I would type my password, it would load, and then take me right back to the login screen. A couple times, it's said that an unexpected response or something like that occurred in the device, but I didn't do anything on it.

What's super weird to me is that my iCloud info, everything from my old phone, etc is on the new phone, but only when the SIM card isn't in. When I put the SIM card in, it stays on a screen that says ""update is complete."" When I click on continue, it tells me to connect to a computer when I'm already connected, or just that I'm connected but nothing else. I have absolutely no idea what to do. It has my background, apps, old texts, contacts, photos, etc. but only when the SIM card isn't in it. I have no idea what to do, and I don't even really know how to describe this issue.

"Question about downsizing iPhone XR Thinking about downsizing...A few questions and advice needed!

I want to downgrade my iphone 10R to a smaller model. This phone is in very good condition.

I used to have the original iphone SE. Could get it for about 150. The new SE seems to be around 400.

I’m essentially wondering how much value I could get out of my current phone if I were to trade it in. It’s in very good condition like I said. Would they give me a straight swap for the new SE? Would I have to pay 100 bucks or so? More than that? 

Like I also mentioned, the SE original is about 150 online. Would it be a mistake (from a financial standpoint) to try and sell my current phone and buy the original SE? I’m trying to get as much value out of this as I can.

This post might be a bit jumbled but if someone could decipher and potentially give me some advice that would be much appreciated.

"Replaced iPhone 7 battery and now no Taptic vibration. Replaced Taptic since and still not working. Help! I replaced my iPhone 7’s battery a few weeks ago and when it came back on the vibrations were a lot more intense than they were before.  Then the next day the vibrations were gone completely.  So I ordered a replacement Taptic Engine part and replaced that, and it still isn’t working.  

Anyone have any ideas?  

Additional info:  

When I first finished the battery replacement I realized the ribbon cable that connects the charger port and microphone were unplugged.  I plugged them back in and the phone was boot looping.  I then realized that when that ribbon cable was unplugged I could boot the phone all the way up, but obviously the phone wouldn’t charge and I’d have no microphone.  I then found a happy medium where I’d plug the ribbon cable in, but only gently and then I’d have a working phone, until the Taptic Engine went out the next day.   

Is the microphone/charger port that connects to the main board in any way related to the Taptic Engine?  I’m wondering if there’s some damage to the ribbon cable connection that is causing all the problems...?  I’m tempted to open my phone back up to mess with that one ribbon cable that was causing the boot loop issues to see if I get anything at all out of the Taptic Engine.

"Phone Reset lost pictures Hello, so I'm trying to help my brother and hopefully someone has answers. On Sunday my brothers iPhone went into recover mode or maybe a boot loop (I wasnt there so I dont know) and the phone was doing something weird. My mother got concerned and immediately took him to sprint and I think they factory reset his phone. With that he lost over 2 years of pictures. Is there anything we can do to find those pictures. They are not backed up on the cloud for some reason it never automatically did it and I have already bought and tried ibeesoft. Please help",0
"Can I get Applecare on a replacement phone? So my 11's back glass shattered (while it was in an otterpop case, not sure how it happened), and even though we bought Applecare originally when we got the phones, the person whose card was being used for the monthly billing got a new card and forgot to update it, long story short our Applecare expired through unintentional lack of payment and we couldn't get it back. 

So I took it to our local Apple service provider and they said what they would have to do is send it in and get a new phone, same phone, for $429. Simply replacing the back glass was not an option, according to the store.

So my question, as above: If I go in on this $429 replacement phone, will I be eligible to get Applecare protection on THAT phone?  Anybody have any idea on how that works?",0

"Shared music not appearing in the Music app I would like to be able to listen to the music I have on my computer, but the Music app doesn't show my shared library. Steps I've taken:

- Literally every other device on my network is seeing shared files, including my PC and Apple TV. Those are sharing just fine.

- Every setting on my iPhone 11 points to my shared account ID, the same ID I use to share on other devices, including Music settings, etc.

- The Edit menu simply does not show the shared library.

- YouTube, other searches, the support page, etc have been zero help. The online support communities are rough because I think Apple keeps changing the structure of their apps.

This is my first iPhone, and while I appreciate how smart it is, good grief is it hard to figure out where my files are. My synced videos are in Apple TV, which took forever to solve. The app structure feels inconsistent since they ended iTunes. I wish the naming was the same, like Apple Music, Apple TV, etc.",0

"Catch-22 logging into iMessage and Apple ID with a new phone. Hi!  I just switched to an iPhone (former Android user), and I've been having some trouble getting the calling and texting functions to work.  Here's the situation - 

**Phone Model:** iPhone SE

**Purchase date:** within the last two weeks; my family ordered them as a group

**Country:** United States

**Nature of purchase:** personal use

**OS:** not sure, probably the most recent one

**The issue:**

I recently switched to iPhone from Android, and did not have an Apple ID until today.  I created one and linked it to my email, but have not been able to link it to my phone number.

iOS appears to have created a Catch-22, where I can't send or receive texts through iMessage, or receive calls on the call function, because I haven't activated my phone number on Apple ID; and I can't activate my Apple ID because doing so requires me to receive either a text message or a call on this phone.

**What caused the issue:**
It just came this way.

**Attempted solutions:**
I've tried sending a text message to myself (it failed to send), and I've checked my email and spam folder for iMessages I could have received (none found), since one of the settings says I can receive iMessages there too.

I also tried turning off iMessage in the Messages settings.  This still hasn't allowed me to send messages to myself, which makes me think there might be some kind of problem with my phone number not being attached to this phone.

Does anyone know a way to get around this problem?  I get the sense there must be something I'm missing, since anyone switching to iPhones would run into this problem.",0

"Block a specific group text Just wondering if there is a way to block a SPECIFIC group text thread I’m apart of.

Been apart of this group text for a few years now with around 7 guys on it.  When it started, I was fine with everything and everyone on it.  Eventually got tired of getting so many messages so I turned of the alerts for JUST this text thread.  Also after a while didn’t remain friends with 2 of the participants so naturally I blocked those people specifically but still get this continuing conversation where I get replies from the people I still DO talk to without any context since they’re replying to the blocked ones.

Don’t want to have to have some line-in-the-sand declarative statement to all of them on the thread where I say “hey, I don’t want to be apart of this group text anymore because you guys reply way too much and also I don’t want to hear from Josh or Will anymore so can you guys just take me off of this” but I’m not sure what else there is to do.  As soon as I do that I’ll start getting nothing but resentment from the guys I still communicate with.

The video did not show a person, but rather was just sort of blurry or appeared as though the phone was laying flat and looking at up at the ceiling or down at the ground. When my mom said hello, the person on the other end said ""whoops I didn't mean to do that"" and ended the call. It was not me.

There is no record on my phone that I made any FaceTime calls to her (and I certainly know that I did not make them). 

The contact information associated with the call was all my contact information. It appears that when she clicked on my name in the missed call log, it just took her to her contact information entry for me.

AND, when she clicked on the missed call entry, it initiated a FaceTime call with me, which I answered.

Sliding the sounds bar up and down, silent mode off, turning off many background apps refreshing, deleting some apps. Problem persists. 


Possible causes:

3 months ago, I purchased some cheap ear buds to use and they seemed to permanently mess up the way it reacts to headphones. It will trigger Siri when putting apple headphones in and it will rapid cycle through music or pause and play as if possessed etc. I no longer use headphones with it. 

Other notes:

As I type this, I noticed when an alarm came on, it displayed the volume button as if I were altering it from the external buttons. 

Body of phone is not hot; app battery consumption looks like what I’d assume it to be. 

I hear back and forths as to whether or not iPhone can contract malware. I use an ad blocker and try my best to stay away from any site I’m unsure of. I regularly clean the safari cache and monitor my network. 

Not trying to come across as paranoid, just not sure 100% what to attribute it to. I’m pretty opposed to factory resetting but if it’s the only solution, I accept that. But I’d love any other suggestions. 

Thank you and have a happy day! ♡",0

"Phone making FaceTime calls on its own?? Tonight I set my phone down on the coffee table and went out to the kitchen to talk to my husband.

My Iphone 11 pro has been having an issue over calls/facetime/zoom recently. 

Whether I am on wifi or calling over network, and regardless whether it's a regular call, facetime video/audio, or even zoom, the people I am on the call with will hear my audio cutting out. This happens quite frequently, and happens in the middle of speaking. I cannot figure it out. The phone is up to date, it's been restarted, etc, but there has been nothing to improve this.

The fact that it happens regardless of network/application makes me think it's a phone hardware issue; however, if the mic was bad or something I would just assume my outgoing audio wouldn't work at all.

I intend to watch some videos and do some research myself but if anybody could point me in a direction. I could afford a grand for one like the 11 pro, but it would be quite expensive for me if that makes sense. Not rich at all. I don’t need much ‘ power’ or anything, I’m not a photographer, or a music producer or any of that. I just call, text, social media, play games, listen to music and watch netflix on my phone.

So in that sense is there any point in getting say an 11 pro over an 11, or even that over an X?

What’s the difference between the X, XR and XS as well?

I would normally assume more expensive is better but they’re all similarly priced as well. As you can see I am very confused and any help would be much appreciated haha

"About a month into moving from Android and I hate it. Is there hope? I've been using Android since day one. I finally decided to make the switch after breaking my Galaxy S10 and receiving an iPhone 7 for free from a friend.

I'm aware that I took a massive step back as far as hardware goes, but I still feel like the baseline experience is lackluster and I'm really frustrated. I have a suspicion that hardware isn't the source of my issues and it's more of an iOS problem. Hopefully you can fill me in.

My first complaint is the notifications. I miss shit all the time. It seems like if I don't see a text as it comes in I lose it to the ether. Android has persistent icons in the top bar to indicate notifications. As far as I can tell the only equivalent in iOS is the badges on icons. Am I missing something important?

The second and definitely most annoying is the keyboard. I can't type worth a damn on this thing. It autocorrects words for seemingly no reason. I've tried using gboard to help the transition but it seems to be suffering from the same issue. Is there an OS level problem here? Am I just used to nicer screens?

Almost everyone else in my life is on iPhone so I would like to try to make it work. I'm not opposed to shelling out for a new phone if it will solve my issues. I just saw the free phone as a great chance to try it out.

I then went to my iPhone and deleted all those apps. My space on my iPhone is back to 400-500mb free. Where did the extra 2.5GB go? It’s like something soaked it up?

Any insight?

"iPhone X on reboot loop My iPhone X is currently in a reboot loop and unresponsive. It is not backed up to iCloud. 

Background: This happened last night after it hit maximum storage and I attempted to back my phone up to iCloud, which seemed to overwhelm my phone's processing capacity (apps wouldn't work, etc). I canceled the back-up and tried to clear some space, but then wasn't able to actually delete photos/videos.

I tried a hard reset without success, and my phone would not be recognized on iTunes or finder when plugged into a MacBook or PC. 

When I was on the phone with Apple support, the specialist walked me through trying to get my iPhone in recovery mode and trying to update it. I was able to get iTunes to recognize my phone and begin the update process, but then it told me my phone could not be updated because of an unknown error (14). I know restoring is an option, but I'm trying to figure out any way to not lose data. I would do anything and pay any amount to avoid that.

After putting my sim in at the spot the LTE icon came up in the top right corner and so i finished the transaction and got it home. After calling Sprint they confirmed my fear that the device was still financed and that they couldn't unlock it.

"ATT Prepaid IPhone 7 (Plz Help) I wanted an extra phone to continue practicing and immersing myself in a language I’m learning.

Clerk said they didn’t have any 7’s unlocked so I said “Fuck it what if you just sold me an ATT iPhone inactivated (with intentions to unlock it then put it to simple mobile fuccyeh). He said it would be $199 and I’m honestly not sure if that’s a good price for a goddamn 7 in 2020 but I have money saved to where the number really didn’t make me flinch for a phone I’ve found myself very content with before. Here’s the problem; Homie sells me the phone, I go home, and there’s a fucking prepaid SIM for the first month of service in the bag. I know for sure if the phone was activated then and there it would’ve been $99 w a commitment to 6 months minimum service. BUT I specifically told him what I wanted to do, and payed about $212 after taxes so it doesn’t seem like he locked me to that 6 month agreement and perhaps the one month SIM was the deal for someone who wanted the latter (Just buying the phone). Still, it leaves me confused as hell and I still have the phone in it’s plastic wrapping. I’m afraid to request an unlock ticket because it seems like I just accidentally agreed to a prepaid plan. my gut is telling me there is a way around this, and if not, then to find out before opening the box so I can return it.

I’ve got an iPhone 6 with 12.4.4. Purchased in 2014 in the US for personal use. 

As of like midnight last night, everything was fine. When I woke up this morning my calendar (I use the Apple default app) was gone and so were almost all of my contacts. 

Things I’ve looked at:

I am still signed in on the iPhone. 

I checked and all the calendars are clicked to show in the app - just now only the holidays have anything. (The other options besides Holidays are Work and Home; not sure what I used before but it was just whatever the default was.)
Checked iCloud, only to discover that my phone wasn’t backing up to iCloud :(

Things I have not done:

Signed out and back in to my phone (don’t want to lose my safari tabs and I don’t know if they’re part of the backup I did earlier today or if signing out will lost them; concerned that logging out &amp;amp; in will “lock in” the problem). 

There is also my concern that signing out will apparently delete, like everything? I can restore from a backup, but won’t that just leave me in the position I’m in?

Updated to the newest iOS (also concerned that updating will “lock in” the problem)

Restored from iCloud (apparently my phone hasn’t been backing up to iCloud; yay)

Things I’m not sure about:

My most recent backup was from 2/1 - is there any way to restore just the calendar and contacts from that backup, or is it an all or nothing thing?

Thanks again!

ETA: Since this happened, I just tried to add something to my calendar and noticed that it picks “Work” as default. I’m all but positive that wasn’t the case before. Was there something other than “Work” or “Home” that I could have been adding to? The phone also logged me out of Twitter but not any other app I’ve noticed.",0

My iPhone X is currently caught in a boot loop. I bought it off a friend the other day who told me it was caught in the loop, but I bought it hoping to fix it.

What happens is, it after I run the restores, they appear to complete like normal.

Yesterday, when I was getting out of the car, the phone fell out of my lap and hit the ground softly in its case, and did no damage to the phone, but it then randomly booted up properly and allowed me to setup the phone.

"iPhone X Display Not Working The display on my iPhone X will not turn on, but the phone itself works as evidenced by my alarms going off and text messages coming through (I can feel the vibration). This happened to me a few weeks ago and I tried hard resetting it and restoring as a new phone through my computer. Though I was able to do that, it didn't fix the problem. Instead, I left it alone overnight and it was fine the next day.

Yesterday however, I noticed my screen flashing in a strange way shortly before it stopped working at all. I left my phone alone overnight, hoping again for that to fix it, but was not as lucky this time.

I don't know what could have caused this, but it seems to me like it could be a physical problem (water damage?) but I can't recall any incident that would have damaged it.

Any suggestions?",0

"iPhone Update failure Hello, I am currently trying to complete my university exams and my iPhone has failed, so ""I am ah very stress"" (Borat voice)

I have an iPhone XR (64gb if that has any relevance)  which was running iOS 13.2, and I just attempted to update it to iOS 13.5 using my MacBook Pro which is running macOS Catalina Version 10.15.3. 

My iPhone had about 2.3gb of free space on it before updating, and as a precaution I backed it up to my MacBook. I then proceeded to follow the prompts on my MacBook to update my iPhone. The update file downloaded to my MacBook and then my MacBook restarted my iPhone and began the update. This progressed up until roughly 80% to 90% according to the progress bar (referring to the black screen with the white apple logo with the progress bar underneath). My MacBook then gave me an error message which went something along the lines of ""An unknown error has occurred with your iPhone Update"" and then almost immediately the MacBook unrecognized my iPhone, even though it was still plugged in. 

It has been stuck like this for over an hour. My laptop refused to acknowledge that my iPhone is plugged into it, my iPhone won't respond to any buttons, and it is still stuck on the progress bar screen.

"Question about iBeacon Hello everyone and thanks to anyone who can help answer my question

I have a friend coworker who works in the same building as his significant other (different departments). Without going into too much detail, their relationship has broken trust between them and therefore his girlfriend is constantly looking for him in the building. He'll be in some random location within the building working and she'd somehow find him.

I've only just learned about iBeacon (Pixel user here) and the moment I learned about it, I had an 'Aha! ' moment. This is how she must be finding my friend in the building all the time. But having tried YouTube and Google to see if anything comes up about iBeacon stalking, nothing comes up.

My question is rather simple. Is it truly possible for my friend's girlfriend to have set up an iBeacon on his phone without his knowledge, and track him accurately and effectively using her phone?

"Web Clips Requiring Permission to Open Apps After Updating to 13.4.1 (iPhone 7) I have some custom icons for a few apps via a profile made in Configurator 2 by creating web clips with the URL set to the URL scheme for the app (e.g. googlechrome:// for Chrome), but after updating to iOS 13.4.1, the web clips are now requiring permission to open the apps I set them to. 

It takes 5-10 seconds to load, then asks ""Open this page in ""App Name""?"" with the options to cancel or open below, whereas before the app would instantly launch. I reinstalled the profile and messed a bit with some of the settings (such as disabling full screen) and checked that the schemes hadn't changed, but haven't had any luck figuring out what part of the update caused this change.

"Any way to prevent apple logo from flashing when power button is pressed while powered down? I have a 2016 iPhone SE running iOS 13.4.1. There is a hardware issue where the iPhone pretty much constantly receives input as if the top button is being pressed, even when it isn't and the 'click' of the power button appears to be working fine. In my searches it seems [this](https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=iPhone+SE+Power+and+Volume+Buttons+Flex+Cable&amp;rh=p_85%3A2470955011&amp;dc&amp;qid=1589943712&amp;rnid=2470954011&amp;ref=sr_nr_p_85_1) needs to be replaced, which seems to be a highly challenging/technical hardware fix. I am hesitant to attempt it, but may one day

However, I bought this phone second-hand simply for using while exercising due to its convenient size. So it will be powered down 97% of the time and I can manage with the screen being on the whole time the other 3%.

What is highly inconvenient is that even while powered down, when the phone receives input that the top button is being pressed, the screen flashes on with the apple logo on for \~5 seconds/off \~5 seconds. This drains the battery pretty quickly even though it's powered down.

Is there any way to stop this from happening? I'd hate to have to keep it charging every moment it isn't in use or else have the battery sit idle, totally drained.",0
"iPhone not sending audio during phone calls Hi everyone, first time here so any help is appreciated. Here's hoping I give you all the info you need on the first go.

- iPhone model and iOS version

iPhone 8 64GB Grey, iOS 13.4.1

- Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

I'm almost certain the phone is no longer under warranty, and if the problem is so dire that it would require repair/replacement beyond what I am able to do myself, I'll just buy a new one. So I wouldn't dwell on this.

- What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

The issue is as follows; when using the Phone app to make a call, I can hear whoever I am calling just fine, but they are unable to hear me. They are able to hear me when I plug in headphones, or use the speaker phone, but not when I hold the phone to my ear. The problem started yesterday and has been replicated on every call I've made since, regardless of the app used. (e.g. Facebook Messenger).

- What caused the issue?

Unknown.

- What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

I have tested the microphone in the voice memo's app and it picks up sound fine. I reset the network settings on the phone as well as the general settings. I did a soft reset on the phone. I've turned off Bluetooth. I have cleaned the lightning port to the best of my ability. I have turned off noise canceling in accessibility.

- Any other information you think might be useful.

The problem seemed to spring up out of no where. I haven't made any software updates or anything that might have acted as a catalyst I don't think. The strangest thing to me is that the headphones and speaker phone will both transmit audio, but not the standard mic. Furthermore, it's strange to me that the standard mic can detect sound in the voice memos app, but will not send it out over any kind of call.

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. I'll be monitoring this closely and trying anything suggested.

UPDATE: I'm still testing things. When I rub my thumb over the bottom microphone in a call, the person on the other end can hear it.",0

"Resolution of iPhone photos So I've played around with the various camera and storage options on my iPhone 8. These include the Optimize iPhone Storage and Most Compatible settings. When I look at the resolution of my photos, I see they are all 3088x2320 (this is for the FaceTime camera which is reportedly 7 MP) and take about 1-1.5 MB for JPEG and roughly half that for HEIC photos. If I view the photos on my 1920x1080 monitor they start to get grainy. I don't think this is an issue with transferring the photos to my computer, because I don't have to zoom in too far on my phone before the picture is relatively blurry.

Am I wrong in thinking that a photo should never start to get grainy util the photo is smaller than the screen it is being displayed on? If I am correct, what can I do (whether it is a camera setting, storage setting, or transfer setting) to get my photos to look good on a larger monitor?",0

"iPhone 8 [13.1.1] : Messages defaulting to iMessage for Android SMS recipient. Thanks in advance for anyone that can help.

The recipient has a Mac with usage of the iMessage platform and an Android phone.
The messages tend to default to iMessage despite the selected phone number being Android.

If I have sent an iMessage to the recipient earlier in the day and then I want to send a text message, even though I select the mobile number (rather than the associated iMessage email address) it defaults to blue text in the ‘To’ section.

Even if I go ‘new message’ and type in the Android phone number manually, it still defaults to blue. Copy and pasting makes no difference either. 

If I hard press and ‘forward’ the message after it defaults to iMessage, it’s usually the same issue. I don’t think I’ve seen a ‘send as SMS’ option pop up. 

If I go to the contacts and find the person, go ‘message’ and then ‘mobile’ or select their number, it will still set the ‘To’ text to blue/iMessage.

Even if they SMS me, and I try to reply straight back, it will tend to default to whatever I had used to message THEM last, and if it’s an iMessage to their Mac, it almost creates a cycle. I hope that makes sense?

It’s been doing this for some time, and is variable/intermittent with no pattern, despite undertaking the last few iOS update, restarting the phone, restating the messages app and turning iMessages on and off. 

Is anyone else struggling with this? I suppose it’s probably something technical, but it can be really irritating if you’re trying to contact someone with something important and they don’t see the message straight away, because it will be sitting in their email inbox instead, if their Mac isn’t open!

Side note: I feel like I can still select numbers fine through my Mac, so I hope it’s not some weird communication issue between my iPhone and Mac. I have got messages synced with iCloud too, if that would be make any difference to the issue.

"Just got the new iPhone SE 2020 - not authorized to make purchases?!? Got the new SE. everything transferred over fine. 
I’m unable to get a paid version of an app because “This device isn’t authorized to make purchases”. 

After doing some research, I found this was due to a ScreenTime Passcode - that I DID NOT set up. I can’t reset the code, remove it, or disable the restrictions!!

I’ve tried the forgot password link... and I input my Apple ID, but it won’t let me reset it. Just goes back to the login screen, and won’t let me type anything in because I’ve entered it wrong over 12x. So I have to wait an hour between each try. 

Looking online, I can’t find a default. I definitely did NOT set one up and I’ve tried all the codes I would have used ?!

"Use phone for 2 days or charge overnight Hi guys

Curious in your opinion which is better for overall battery health:

1) Using phone for 2 days without charging, battery gets down to 35-40%, charge night of second day

2) Charge every night, where battery only gets down to ~75% from the day. 

I understand that in total it comes out to the same amount of charge cycles, but we always read that it’s not great to have the battery at the extremes, high or low.",0

"Old Imaginary Apple ID included in iCloud Backup So we just went through the broken screen song and dance. It doesn't respond to anything, so we can't even link the phone to a Computer (The last computer we linked the old phone to was broken down into it's component pieces with the HD was wiped ages ago. -.-) to salvage the ripped CDs on it. Which is worse because the Backup HD for those rips is ALSO dead (Protect your Tech when you Move Folks!). So we cried at our losses and purchased a ""New to us"" iPhone. Thankfully no drama there, and we were able to restore our backup Almost no problem.

In the course of restoring the backup, it mentions something about ""Some Content"" being attached to a seperate Apple ID and it asks for the password to that ID. The E-Mail displayed has never ""Intentionally"" been used for anything Apple Related, as it is not a real E-Mail. It looks like some kind of perversion of an E-Mail address someone might imagine they had based on their existing E-Mails, and they remember having some E-Mail related headache related to the old iPhone back when they first bought it and took it to an Apple ""Genius"", but nothing ever seemed to come of it. We've checked all relevant places to make sure its not hiding attached to one Apple service or another, but Everything (Facetime, Messages, iCloud, etc.) has the correct E-Mail attached.

The best I can figure is that ""Something"" (An App, a Song, Etc.) *must* have been ""Purchased"" with that nonexistant ID back when the first phone was new, but goodness only knows what. How can we find and remove the offending content to keep the iPhone from incessantly prompting us? That way we can rid all trace of it, and make a new backup without it. We tried to reset the password for it, but of course, they want to send an E-Mail to the imaginary E-Mail Address... which won't work for obvious reasons. -.-

All the ""Official"" help resources say to change to that imaginary address and then change back, but as it doesn't exist, we couldn't get any of the verification E-Mails were we to try such a thing. And goodness forbid we manage to change the entire account over to this imaginary address and get it stuck there. -.- Help Please?",0

"iPhone 8 phone screen is flickering? Hi all, 

I would post a video if I could so please bear with me as I try to explain the issues of the screen.

It is perfectly normal when first booting up the iphone, no issues. However, after a minute or so the bottom 1/3^rd of the screen begins so flicker, brighter. Not much noticable but only so slightly. More so from the bottom of the screen, easing up as it reaches 1/3 up the screen. 

After seconds, the flickering then turns from a ""brightness flickering"" to copy the display from the top of the screen.  For example, it will display (in a flickering pattern) everything from the time, notifications, charge, anything that is shown at the top will flicker at the bottom.

"Any way to make Samsung Health app/fitness tracker as a source of data in Apple Health on iPhone? Hi,

I recently bought a Samsung Fit e fitness band. I downloaded the Samsung Health app and paired it with the Fit e. The thing is, I desperately need the Samsung Health and Apple Health apps to sync with one another on the heart rate and step counter data. The reason being that my health insurer app will only allow the Apple Health app to give it data. And that is the whole reason I bought the Fit e, for the health insurance app. That app is willing to connect with Apple Health app, Fitbit app, Huawei app, Garmin app and a bunch of other. Just not the Samsung health app for some reason.

But for some reason, Apple Health will only use iPhone as a source of data and not the Fit e band or the Samsung Health app. I can only give permission for the Samsung Health app to read data from Apple Health and not write as well.

So yeah, I am hoping someone here can tell if there is a way to get the Fit e/Samsung Health app as a source of data in Apple Health app. Thanks in advance.",0

"SHOULD I REPLACE THE BATTERY OR NOT? Hey there guys i need your feedbacks. 

I got my iphone 6 plus when my brother gave it to me and it works perfectly well for the next 5 months. But when the charging cable went broken (it says accessory not supported) i bought a cheap lightning cable in our local market and also a bought a branded power bank.

My iphone will work just perfect when it is charged but when i am suppose to use it without being charge it cannot even last a minute without restarting. 

So i just wanna ask if i should buy or replace my battery even though my battery health is still on 94%. Where is the problem coming from? Is it from the software or just battery issues. By the way, my brother already replace the battery before he gave it to me (just fyi if that may matter.)",0

"Wiped down my iPhone 7 with toilet paper (water + hand soap soaked). Went over the home button and bottom grills as well. Next, I ran the whole device under tap water for 6-8 secs to partially rinse it off (to make drying it afterwards easier). Home button lost haptic feedback? I’m hoping it’s just a matter of any remaining soapy water drying up before the home button’s taptic feedback starts working again. I’m just worried the soap/water may have somehow gone into the crevices around the home button and messed with the fingerprint sensor, or somehow affected the general internal area near where the home button is located.

The home button itself is still working (e.g. bringing up Siri, unlocking phone, going back home, etc.), however I don’t seem to be getting the vibration that comes with a normal press of the iPhone 7 home button. The closest thing to a vibration that I’m getting is a small distorted squishy sound resembling its click when I press home.

Is this something to wait out? I mean it was only under (cool) water for like 8 secs max. I had the bottom grills facing downwards the entire time (so water wasn’t directly pouring into any of the bottom ports/grills). Isn’t iPhone 7 water resistant (IP67)?

"Extremely Strange Safari Problem Hey everyone. Hoping for some help. Having a really odd problem with Safari on my iPhone XS Max, with 13.4.1 OSX.  Phone was purchased in October 2019. 

Today I pulled up safari and went to type in a web address that began with the letter “S.”  The keyboard froze and so did safari. No big, kill the app and reopen. It’s still stuck on the same page. Kill it a second time and relaunch. It reverts back to the last page I was on. Go to type in the address again and it locks up. Every time I type in “S” as the starting letter it locks and I have to close and open, close and open. 

Did the simple stuff like reboot the phone, and went into web data and started deleting any sites starting with “S” that had any actual data next to it (as opposed to 0.0mb). 

I can type every other letter of the alphabet except for “S”. I’m not sure when this started because the last few days I’ve most stuck to my favorites. 

I’m sure the simplest answer is to clear history and web data. But I’d like to avoid that. 

I can, however, start with “www.s” and get to the site. Also, I’ve got no issues starting with S in my Firefox browser. 

I’m totally perplexed by this. Like I said, clearing all history and web data is the obvious place to start but I’d like to avoid that.

"iPhone Speed Issues Hello everyone,

I have been facing slow internet issues on my iPhone XS and iPhone 6. When I check the speed with other android devices connected to the same network the speed is exactly what I was promised by ISP (60 Mbps). I also get the same speed when checking it from my Laptop. When I run a speed test on any one of my iPhone, I only get 6 to 7 Mbps. Worst part is, my ping latency shows 3 or 4 ms on my iPhone but I still struggle to play online games coz it keeps disconnecting. I have tried forgetting the network but doesn't seem to have worked for me. Anything you can suggest which might help.

P.S : I have tried resetting my iPhone 6 as well but no gain.

"Recover data from before factory reset Before I start, I'm an idiot and I've learnt my lesson, please don't tell me this, I know.

My last backup was from about a year ago on my old phone.

My 11's memory was full and I've been backing up videos slowly to dropbox. I was trying to delete stuff to clear out the memory yesterday morning but it wasn't responding so I tried to restart it, this sent it into a boot loop. Tried all the tricks to get it out but it would only stop while I was holding the power button after force restart (spent all day doing this).

A message came up on the screen to connect to a computer and gave the link to [support.apple](https://support.apple). something or other so I followed it. Went to itunes and it said it would download the latest ios and try to fix it, but that if that didn't work I would need to do a factory reset, clicked okay and it went straight into a factory reset but I didn't realise what it was doing (it said it was 'restoring' and my stupid ass thought it was restoring ios).

In a panic I set it to load the last backup I had which turned out to be the one from over a year ago.

Is there anything I can do to recover my original files?

I'm willing to do pretty much anything at this point. Illegal, costly, whatever, I don't care. This thing had pictures of my dead grandmother, lost pets, people and pets I'm stuck 300 miles away from in this lockdown.

Basically, you have the built in audio controls (in the control center, lock screen, or using buttons on headphones).

"XS spazzing out and twitching like its being touched a lot  

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*XS on 13.3.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

USA on the date it was released from best buy for personal use

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

I noticed trying to back out of an app in the top left of the screen it wasn't registering touch. then it just started spazzing out like i was scrolling or touching everywhere. It eventually chilled out after sleeping it and waking it. But every couple of minutes it tweaks out again really crazy. when I try to text someone it scrolls up in their convo up and up. Someone sent me a message on IG and just trying to unlock the phone it opened the message and then started typing random shit and emojis. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

seemingly nothing. I have not dropped it or got water on it. It pretty much just sits on my couch next to me during all this. I live alone so its not like I have a kid that messed with it and isn't telling me. 

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I cleaned off the screen. then tried holding side button to turn off, which was hard because the upper area of the screen doesn't always sense touch so I couldn't swipe it to turn off. then I did the vol up vol down side button hold to reboot. 

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

Over a year ago I cracked the screen and got it replaced at a third party repair place called UBREAKWEFIX or something. It was fine except when I put it on the wireless charger it would do this same ghost touching twitch thing but I brought it back to them and they said it may have been a shit digitizer. they replaced it and everything has been good since then. 

I also have a screen protector but its undamaged and clean and had not been a problem.",0

"How does auto-brightness work in conjunction with the brightness control in control center? As the title says, I am curious to know exactly how auto-brightness works. When it auto-adjusts, does the brightness level adjustment bar in control center also move up/down the corresponding amount? It doesn’t seem to afai can tell. Does the manual adjustment (when auto is turned on) just set a “range” or general level of brightness? Or does using the manual brightness control bypass auto brightness altogether? Just interested in understanding this feature a little better, as I do regularly tweak brightness manually but can appreciate the software bringing it down to save battery if I’m in the dark.

"Offloading apps So I’m using an iPhone 7 on iOS 13.3.1 and I’m so sick of the offloading feature.

It seems like a really good idea and has a lot of potential but it’s just horse shit.

I was literally just using the mail app - which I use around ten times a day - and i didn’t even close it down when switching to another app, and thats when it happened. I jumped back to the homescreen, everything was fine, I swiped right to another set of apps and swiped back (habit) and my iPhone suddenly decided that I don’t need the mail app which is one of my most used apps, and starts to offload it while it was still open in the background. What the fuck?! Not only that, but it also started offloading the calculator app and the contacts app, both of which i also use a lot and both of which could be essential in an emergency.

None of those apps take up much space and yet I still have a selection of games that I havent touched in months and take up gigabytes of data that haven’t been offloaded ever.

There must be an option to select which apps to keep forever? Or does Apple just not care?",0

"2 phone numbers, 1 iphone Hey Reddit, 

I received a business phone which is a lot better than my personal phone, I would like to use it primarily while still keeping my personal phone on the side but without carrying it around.

I was wondering if there’s a way I can forward all calls/messages sent to my personal phone over to my business phone? 

And also would there be a way for my responses/history to be forwarded back to my personal phone as well if I responded from my business phone? In a sync kind of fashion, would this just be done via iCloud? 

Overall, this is more of functional thing and I’m just looking at my options to roll this out. Both phones are in a plan and I’m not sure my company will let me swap my personal number over or add a dual/e sim, so I’m limited to using an app to do this.

"IPhone SE 2020: Should I use a screen protector or not? Hi guys, just found this sub and was thinking some of you might be able to help with my conundrum. I’m a student and recently got the new SE after saving up for a while and I absolutely love it so far. The only problem I’ve been having (and it seems to be a common problem) is that all the screen protectors that I’ve bought and tried that say they will fit the iPhone 8 / new SE leave huge air bubbles along the sides of the phone. I’m guessing that the SE screen must be more curved than the 8? Either way, it’s a really annoying problem and I can’t bear to use a protector with the big bubbles on the sides. 

I’m wondering whether I should just give up and not bother with a screen protector, or whether I should just keep trying different protectors until I find one that fits. Has anyone managed to find one so far that doesn’t leave these air bubbles? If not, would it be reasonably safe to just put a bumper case on the phone and keep it in a phone pouch or sock or something when putting it in my bag? I am worried about breaking the screen since like I said, I’m a student and funds are tight. But at the same time it’s proven so difficult to find one that fits and looks good, and the naked screen just feels and looks so much nicer than any of the protectors I’ve tried. Any advice?",0

"iPhone Storage issue Hi there, so my gf has been having some pretty bad storage issues and with the current pandemic she cant get it into a store or let me look at it etc so ill try explain it all as best as possible.

iPhone 7 Plus 32gb. with 25gb iCloud storage. There are about 5 apps on the phone as she has tried to delete them all to save storage. Curretly on iOS 13.2 but cant update the software because of the storage issue.

Both iCloud and phone storage were full so she deleted apps etc photos but after this happened the storage never updated but the apps are gone and then photos would say they are deleted by then re appear shortly after. Her photos take up the most space but no where near the 25gb she could use the cloud to store them in.

Another issue that old photos become blurry and cant be viewed properly. Why is this?I've tried to point her to a few things but havent been able to resolve it. Some apps started to show a cloud with an arrow i think next to them before they were 'deleted'.

Anyone have any ideas to help resolve this? I tried the apple forums and then told me to check the storage and delete stuff, yes I have already done that unsurisingly haha.

"(HELP) Need to Take Low Res Photos Hi there!

So for work I take tons and tons of photos everyday (500-1000), and my company has a cloud where I upload them, but in order to conserve space I need them to be small files. They prefer 640x480. 

Obviously iPhone natively takes high resolution photos, and aside from changing the photo “compatibility” settings and the video resolution, I haven’t been able to find a way to take 640x480 pics with the camera. 

My last work phone was an android and I had an app that would let me take 640x480 pics, but I haven’t had any luck finding an app like this for iPhone. 

Right now I’m stuck using Microsoft picture manager to resize them after plugging into my computer after a long day of work and doing it manually. It’s a huge pain in the ass, and would save me so much time if I could make them low resolution right from my iPhone, and upload them on the spot using my data. 

Does anybody know of any apps or hidden settings that can help with this?

All input is much appreciated.

"Conversation Deleted So I have an iPhone 8 and a week ago it spazzed out and restarted and nothing seemed to have changed when it powered on except for ONE of my text conversations with another iPhone user. All of the texts I had with him on this phone were deleted except for the few I suspect were sent from him as text messages (not iMessages). When it first happened I noticed I now had two convos with him, one with everything and the other with just the random non iMessage ones, so I deleted the one that didn’t have everything. Then I rechecked and it had reverted to what the other one looked like. I’m really confused because it was just this one conversation that had problems.

"iPhone photos to Windows 10 I'm having really annoying problems backing up my wife's photo's to my PC. I'm an android user so please bear with me if my knowledge seems stupid. I haven't had an iPhone since the 4 (briefly with the 7 but never plugged it into a PC). My wife has 10'000's of photos and I'd like to put what I can on my PC and eventually into the cloud. I'd do this directly to google cloud but I don't want it running in the background all day, I can schedule this on my PC run in the small hours of the night (bandwidth isn't amazing so i don't want it ruining our internet during the day).

1. It's my understand that iCloud and her phone are fully synced and I cannot have stuff in the cloud but not of the phone?  
If this is the case my aim here is to add them to my google drive, as I believe she can download google photos and view things on her phone and it seems there's workaround to have it delete photos from the phone but not the cloud.
2. First thing I did was plug it into my PC and from memory. It worked like a USB stick for photos. I was simply going to copy and paste them.  
It's only showing me a handful of photos in a handful of folders. 103APPLE, 105APPLE...107,1108 111,117,121,125 and 126. Some are empty, some have a single photo in them and the last one has about 20.   
I tried using photos as per apple's instructions but just see's the above photos.   

3. I previously set up iCloud on my PC to sync with a folder on my PC. It's hasn't synced since January (I know it's been on as I've seen it running on several occasions. 
4. Iit's on now and not doing everything). I ran it not long ago and it's downloading 26,000 items. I suspect I'm getting more duplicate copies of photos. I had previously seen it up to date. It was easy to set up on my C drive but a pain in the ass (and I work in IT) to set up on a secondary drive. Ideally, I don't use iCloud as it's a hunk of shit and I've tried to use it several times over the years and is by far the most troublesome program I've ever had to deal with (and I have many clients that use all sorts of weird and wonderful programs).

"iPhone 11 regularly gets stuck on Twitter app Hello I have had a persistent issue with my iPhone 11 for a little over a month now. I am running the latest version of ios 13. 

My issue is that every other or so (with now increased regularity) my phone will get stuck on an app (so far it has been twitter approximately 5 times and Instagram once). When this issue occurs the app that my phone is stuck on remains fully functional, and I still receive notifications from other apps and can view them from the pull-down menu. If I click on the apps though I cannot switch apps. I am unable to use the swipe bar to view other open apps, or access the home screen. If someone calls me my phone will vibrate but the prompt to answer the call is never brought up. If I hold the power button to attempt to power off the phone it brings up siri and never brings up the screen to swipe and power off the phone, the same occurs when I attempt to restart the phone. Connecting my phone to my laptop has not resolved the issue either. 

Currently, when the issue occurs I simply wait for my phone to die, plug it into a charger and restart it. However, what was once an issue every couple weeks has no happened with more regularity. My phone is currently acting up and the did so as well last Friday (5/1) which was 3 days ago. 

I am mostly curious if anyone else has experienced these issues and if there are any solutions. Thanks in advance.",0
"Camera roll stuck buffering Every time I go to watch a video or see a photo on my phone, the little white circle appears and I have to wait while it buffers now. 

This is NOT to do with the iCloud.  I don’t have any of the photos of videos online and I don’t have the camera roll online for it to download. 

Now from my best guess of what’s happening, is that when my phone was recently full, I ran out of space, the phone compressed all the videos and pictures as a self defense mechanism.  

But I’ve deleted a whole bunch of stuff and made plenty of space now. 

How do I get the phone to decompress the camera roll now??

"Message Notifications Don't Work When Phone is Locked **Phone Model:** iPhone 11 running iOS 13.4.1

**Purchase Date/Location and Use:**  October 2019 from the apple website in the US for personal use

**The Problem:** When I receive a text message/iMessage notification while my screen it locked, the screen does not wake, does not vibrate, and there is no ding/vibration when in ringer mode either. I do not have these problems if the screen is awake and locked or awake and unlocked. Occasionally the notifications will work properly immediately after locking my phone, but majority of the time, the notification simply doesn't work. I still get banners, badges, and even the lock screen icon bar. Notifications for all other apps work normally almost all the time.

**What I've Tried:** I have tried everything I can think of including: changing all notifications settings, hard restarts/shutdowns, updating the phone (this happened before 13.4.1), simply changing sounds and vibration patterns, covering/uncovering the light sensor (I don't know why I thought this would change anything), etc. Nothing has changed the problem.

**What Causes the Issue:** The only thing I can identify that causes the issue is locking the phone screen. I haven't found anything else that causes the issue.

What could possible be causing this issue? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. It has become quite annoying missing messages for an extended amount of time, especially incase of important information. Thanks everyone!",0

"HEIC images taken on iPhone X are larger than Apple's Image Capture exports TL;DR: Image Capture on the Mac is exporting HEIC images smaller than they were stored on the iPhone. Am I losing photo quality here and if so how do I transfer my iPhone's photos exactly as they are saved on the device?

Full Details: 

To make use of all the time we've got right now as a result of the quarantine, I've been collecting all my photos from various different devices over the years and storing them in one location ready to upload to the cloud.  

Although I had my fair share of issues with some Android phones, trying to get the photos off my iPhone X onto a Windows PC has been nothing short of a nightmare. I won't go into it too much here but I want to upload these photos into the cloud as JPG's not HEIC's, however, iOS's automatic conversion feature does not work at all and crashes everytime I try to move the folders over. I also get the same result when I turn on the 'Keep Originals' option. 

After much frustration, I've decided to use the Image Capture application on my Macbook Air to just move the entire library over to a USB as HEIC's. Then I'll find a good converter to change them into JPG's. When I compare the exported file on my USB to the exif data of the exact same photo on my iPhone X though, I'm noticing massive size differences. Often entire megabytes... 

I want these transferred photos to be the same quality as they are on the phone itself. That's why I haven't used any 3rd party transfer tools, to avoid a loss in quality. Image Capture seems to be doing this anyway though. 

Does anybody understand why Image Capture is exporting my photos at a drastically lower size than the originals and how I can get around this at all? Any suggestions or ideas would be much appreciated!",0

I’ve since changed all my passwords, and he isn’t legally allowed to have a phone (related to using my browser for disgusting things, like worst case scenario disgusting things.), but there’s more than likely a chance he’s still using one, so I’m a little bit paranoid and scared, I’d appreciate any input or opinions or advice, thanks in advance!

Tl;dr, should I be concerned about microphone noises going off and screen record banner appearing when I’m not activating either or is it just my iPhone SE being old?",0

"Stopped receiving notifications for messaging apps? Iphone 7 plus, 13.3.1. This started happening about two weeks ago, but apps like Gmail, fb messenger, Instagram dms, Signal (a text messaging app), all have stopped sending me any kind of push notifications. I didn't change anything with my notification settings when this started happening, and have since checked and made sure everything was on. 

I've tried turning push off for these apps, soft resetting, push back on and soft resetting again, but I still have to open the app to see if anything new has been recieved. This is especially inconvenient on the part of Gmail as I need to respond to some things I receive in a very timely manner. 

Text messages are unaffected. (I think. Occasionally, group texts will come in a day late all at once or something like that, but it's only group texts that happens with so I'm fairly sure that's unrelated.) 

Push notifications from apps like regular fb and freaking Wendy's are unaffected. It's just messaging apps.

"My iPhone 6 died  I have an iPhone 6 (don’t know the iOS). It currently has no warranty.

My phone died yesterday.

For about two months I’ve been using for about half of the time an extension cord from which the charger would come out and disconnect easily / wouldn’t sit firmly. For about 2-3 weeks the phone started having problems with charging. I would plug the phone and it wouldn’t start charging unless I would:

\-unplug it and plug it back in, but turned 180 degrees

\-unplug it and plug it back in a lot of times

\-leave it plugged for a longer period of time

(none of the things above were a definite solution, usually 1 of the 3 would work, but I never knew which)

Yesterday I let it charge like usual in that extension cord (I think the battery was about 40%) and found it dead 20 mins later. The phone wasn’t dropped or hit or anything.

I cleaned the charging port (although there was nothing there). I long pressed the home and the lock button. I plugged it into the laptop. I let it charge for a longer period of time. I bought a new cable and did all of the above.

The screen shows nothing.

I also wanted to check the charging port connector and disconnect and reconnect the battery connector, like in this video ([https://youtu.be/gvTgzugSpiM?t=257](https://youtu.be/gvTgzugSpiM?t=257)), but I didn’t find small enough screwdrivers to unscrew those 2 tiny screws.",0

"How to use separate iPhones for personal and work with the same Apple ID? Hello Reddit,

I’ve been an iPhone user for over 5 years, currently with my XS. I finished up my college recently and have a lot of work needs on my phone, especially calls and WhatsApp. I got the XS when it launched especially for the dual sim, so that I can use separate numbers for work and personal. However, lately, it’s not been enough differentiation and I’ve decided on getting an entirely separate phone, which is helped w a relatively inexpensive SE2 coming into the picture. 

I’m deep into the ecosystem so android wasn’t an option for me, but I’ve a major concern which I’ve not been able to solve by googling. I want to know how I can set up that phone with the same Apple ID in a way that it doesn’t sync data such as the messages or photos from my personal phone while still being able to sync data to iCloud which is natively on my work phone. I also want to know if I can use that phone w my Apple Watch since it’s the same Apple ID or not.

"dropped iPhone X, cameras not working, options moving forward Hi everyone!

I have an iPhone X that fell from a kitchen counter to the ground this morning and now the Face ID, front camera, rear camera, and flash/flashlight don't work (both in the camera app and third-party camera apps). The screen just stays all black. I had some light cracks on the back from prior drops but no new cracks after this most recent one. I tried restarting, updating to iOS 13.4.1, reset all settings, force restarting, taking the SIM out and putting it back in again, and checking for water damage (just in case) inside the SIM card slot.

Based on everything I've seen online it seems like it may be a hardware issue. Are there any other suggestions for troubleshooting before I look into repair options? Does repair even seem like a reasonable option at this point or is there likely to be more internal damage?

"11 Pro Battery Help I'm actually asking for my father, who's in California (I'm in NYC) so I can't help him directly. He's been having super fast battery drain and trying everything that he can to deal with it (factory resetting, turning off bluetooth/data/FaceID/etc.) and tracking battery usage to see what the culprit is.

He'll be down to 70% in \~3 hours without using any of the above services and some light texting/a phone call. 

Apple sent him a new phone, same issue arising. I'm wondering if there are some apps that can drain battery \*without\* being noticed by the Battery Usage Monitor? 

I'm suggesting that he factory reset and then manually reinstall apps, 1-by-1, though I feel bad that he's having to do that.

"Transferring texts to new iPhone Hello, two days ago I upgraded to an iPhone XR from an iPhone 6s. I used the old phone to set up the new phone so everything should have transferred over. The only thing I’m having an issue with is texts. Only about half of my texts transferred to the new phone and I’m missing about a year and a half of texts. 

I checked to make sure that the messages option is on in iCloud settings on both devices, and the 6s model was backed up to iCloud the same day I upgraded. I also pay for extra iCloud storage so that wouldn’t be an issue.

"AppleID problems, can you remove it without involving apple directly as they are as useful as a chocolate teapot So I personally use Android phones for everything, however my wife is a fan of apples products, she uses the XR but we have her old phones such as the 7 and the iphone 5.   


The iPhone 7 is setup with her current apple ID however the iphone 5 was attached to an old ID that is now defunct, she had the same issue with her Ipad Mini 2 but she got that sorted by apple, because she doesn't use this phone however she just left it how it is and it has sat in a drawer.   


Our kids love to use the phones for education apps, so I was thinking if I can get this phone reset then my daughter can have the apps she likes installed on it, especially whilst we are in lockdown.

I actually have my own account logged into the store part of the phone, but the iCloud account ""is not verified or does not exist"" even when I reset the password via the email address it is linked to.  


Any ideas how I can sort this out myself? If I contact apple they just want my wife to speak to them and she just cannot be bothered with them (she has had them scratch her new laptop and damage the trackpad in the past year so she is reluctant to ask for help from them unless absolutely necessary)

"Browser stops loading webpages I have an iPhone 7 and, as far as I’m aware, the iOS is up to date. 

For a while now, my iPhone eventually stops loading webpages on a tab. This happens when I google something and I go back and forth clicking on multiple links (I very rarely go to websites using the address bar, so I’m not sure if it’s just when searching or not). 

The webpages eventually just come up blank, partially load or load the top end of the page (minus the very top) and I become unable to scroll. If I click back, the webpages that previously worked fine now have the same problem. The way I can get around this is by copying and pasting the web address into a new tab and loading it up from there, where the page loads with no issues. 

I’ve tried various fixes: restarting my iPhone; closing all the tabs in the browser down and manually shutting down the app; changing the search engine; downloading and using the Firefox browser app instead of safari. I’ve also had a look at the safari settings but I can’t find any obvious fixes. 

Of course, it’s driving me mad. I wonder if anybody else has experienced this? I’ve tried to search for solutions on google but I just can’t find anything!

"Finding an app to shut down my sister's iPhone Hey everyone, my family and I are android users and my sister is addicted to her iPhone 7. (The reason why I her brother is typing this and not my parents is because said parents aren't as tech savvy) She is on it CONSTANTLY. For example, today she spent at least 6 hours on Roblox (shows you her age range) and refuses to get off. I know what everyone is thinking, you should talk about this with her and try to figure something out. I agree somewhat on this and our family has already for a year plus tried to get her to understand/socialize with other people in the house. The reason she was on it so much today was that everyone was occupied with work on our property and not really laying the hammer down. We have already tried the Circle app (Netgear router had it integrated until I upgraded the firmware to DD-Wrt) and the circle sucked big time. It would sometimes not sync properly, and it had a fee monthly, etc. Screen time, that's built into IOS sometimes doesn't work and doesn't have functionality with android.

"Asking Questions 101: How To Ask People For Help? There are a lot of posts on this sub with vague questions, vague symptoms, a lot of missing information and bad-explained overall. I wanted to show you how to ask a good question, from an ex-Apple iOS technician.

Here's how to ask a good question:

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*e.g. iPhone XS running iOS 13.2*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

People who answer your issue can suggest certain repairs, e.g. warranty. Country and nature of purchase also helps, since countries have different consumer protection laws. For instance, members of the European Union have a two year warranty at the point of purchase (i.e. that might not be Apple, but your local electronics store if you bought it there) - some countries (e.g. the U.K. and The Netherlands) have even longer periods consumers can claim warranty. 

*e.g. March 20th, 2019 in the Apple Store in the U.K., purchase for personal use*

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

Some issues are continuous, some are intermittent. It is important to let people know what the issue is and how often it occurs. ""iPhone restarts"" as issue, is not enough.

*e.g. iPhone crashes to springboard when opening the camera-app, this happens about three times a day at random moments. It only happens when opening the camera-app.*

**4. What caused the issue?**

There's not always a clear cause, but think about anything that could've caused it. It could be because your phone was in your pocket during heavy rain, or your cat knocked it from your desk. It could be anything.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

So people don't waste time answering possibilities you already tried

*e.g. I tried to force-close the camera app. This did not work. Then I tried to restart the phone, that also did not work.*

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

"1/3 of my total storage taken up by System and Other? Hello!
I have an iPhone 8+ running iOS 13.3, it’ll be two years old next month. I’m planning on upgrading to the 11 soon, but for now, my phone works just fine. However, my storage is almost full, and when I was looking at things to delete in settings, I noticed that the “System” category took up 5.41GB of space (which was expected).

"My speaker doesn’t work anymore !! I was listening to music, casually, volume all the way up, then suddenly the volume drops down and sounds kinda muffled, when I got to the phone, I noticed that the bottom speaker doesn’t work anymore, the sound only comes out of the earpiece, I have an iPhone 8.

Here are the things I tried: blowing air into the speaker, shaking it a little bit (It may be dumb but you never know), apple’s recommendations, water eject although it hadn’t been anywhere near water (that reminds me I had resorted to this around 2 months ago, some water had gotten into one of the speakers, or maybe both, but I eventually got it out (which again reminds me, I think around that same time I experienced something similar, only then I was on Instagram, got the phone to my ear to listen to an audio, and it was stuck on outputting from the earpiece, it worked fine after a simple reboot) I don’t know if any of this is relevant), making a call on speaker works but only through the top speaker, plugging and unplugging headphones, on and off Bluetooth, rebooting, reset settings, and only then did I remember hard reboot was an option, and since it still didn’t work, I tried it too. Finally I tried cleaning up the lightning port and the speaker grill with a sharpened q-tip, although there wasn’t much to clean.

I think the next step is to factory reset, but I’d like to see if there’s anything else I can do.

I saw a video somewhere where they had a similar issue and fixed it by deleting an app that “controls the speakers”, I haven’t installed any new app, is there a way to see which apps do that?, but I guess if that was the case resetting settings should’ve solved it?

Could you help me figure out what could’ve happened? I didn’t really drop it that day (yesterday, this happened ~18h ago), didn’t get no shock or any particular damage. It just happened out of nowhere. Could it be that something disconnected? How? Why? Or maybe the speaker is just dead and needs to be replaced ?

"Battery issues - iPhone 11 PM  Hey! Does anyone also have problems like me? I have iP 11 Pro Max with iOS 13.3.1.

Unfortunately, what surprised me was the battery is discharges faster and in addition at night 6% disappeared, previously it was only3%. What could this depend on? Always limit the available options of this location that constantly collect data, lengthen the work on one charge . Do you think the problem may be in the system?

"iPhone 7 Passcode Change issue So this support issue is about my sibling's iPhone's password changing.  (iPhone 7, bought around 2017 i think, in the Philippines if that helps)

&amp;#x200B;

According to her, she was trying to change her passcode from her old 6 digit code to a 7 digit one. After that she decides to change it back to the original 6 digit code. Apparently, while the code was verifying for quite a while, my other sibling suggests to them that they should turn the iPhone off (not shut it down completely). Now while this appears to work, the phone says it requires a 6 digit code or touch ID, but when we try to unlock the phone with the original 6 digits, it doesn't work. This of course sends the into a panic and is when I arrived home is when they tell me all this. Is there any way this can be solved without reseting the phone or is all hope lost?

"Dropped iPhone 6 and won't turn back on; battery is ok; must be hardware failure? To summarize this:

- Dropped it a day or two ago and won't turn back on, usually when this happened I could fix it by charging it and it will force to turn on. What happened when I did that was it shows the Apple logo and it would turn off again and stuck in that loop.

- Took it for repair and learned that the battery was ok and the phone most likely needed a factory reset, took them an hour to no avail but assured that it could be fixed though I took the phone anyway and went home.

- Tried iTunes and Fonepaw, usually when the recovery is about the start, the phone restarts (when in recovery mode) and then the Apple logo with the loading will show up (based on videos I've watched). This doesn't happened on me and it would just go back to recovery mode and iTunes and Fonepaw would show me error.

When I replace the battery I'll ask them to check the proximity sensor too, maybe the ebay seller changed the screen before selling and damaged something in there, no idea. But how come the sensor's red light is there when it's not working?

Also it came with a screen protector, could that be the reason the sensor doesn't detect anything? Tried with my finger too, nothing. Front facing camera works fine, screen is always clean.

"What's the appeal of wireless charging for iPhones? I have an iPhone XS and I recently picked up an Anker Powerwave pad to try out wireless charging.  So far, I'm not sure I totally understand the appeal of it.

Wireless charging:
- is slower than a high amperage lightning connection (USB Power Delivery)
- requires a more precise positioning than a wired connection (several times I've woken up in the morning with an uncharged phone, having accidentally nudged it off the pad in my sleep)
- prevents the use of other useful rear-mounted phone accessories like magnet car mounts and Pop Sockets
- doesn't continue to charge while you are using the phone (since you've lifted it up from the charging pad)

The only upsides that I can see is that you reduce the daily wear &amp; tear on the lighting port, and that placing it on a pad is somewhat faster and more convenient than reaching for a cable and plugging it in.

I'd love to embrace a wonderful future without wires, but I don't really see the upsides right now.  Am I missing something?",0

Iphone 11 Pro, current iOs version

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**
So im in a semi long distance relationship, 2 hours away, and my significant other and I enjoy video chatting each other when im not close by. She has an Android Samsung Galaxy S10. When we first started video chatting, I had an Iphone X and we used Whatsapp messenger for our video calls. We had ZERO issues when it came to her hearing me and I hearing her. Sometimes I would just regular facetime her work phone which is an iPHone X as well, and everything worked.

My Iphone X shit the bed, and I had to upgrade. I got an Iphone 11 pro. Since day ONE, facebook messenger, facetime app, and whatsapp ALL have ""hearing"" issues. What I mean by this is, the video works fine on both wifi and cellular data. However, 75% of the time, she only hears every other word or sometimes even every 4th or 5th word. Its bad. To the point that we dont video chat much anymore because theres no point due to she cant get what im saying.

Please, there HAS to be a solution. I called Verizon Wireless and because of COVID, they were not much help and told me to basically restart my device and do all that basic stuff. This is not a restart my phone and its fixed type of issue.

"Lost a ton of iCloud data years ago and have been trying to restore what I can. I found a video I’ve been looking for in my old texts, but it just shows a file name, I can’t click or open it. More info below [image of issue](https://imgur.com/gallery/wygLdJB)

I made a post about this issue yesterday, and while there’s no way to retrieve the data from my broken phone, and Apple support couldn’t retrieve my old iCloud data, I was wondering if anyone here knows how I can get this file opened. 

All videos and texts in my messages from before my iCloud mishap won’t show in texts anymore. iCloud randomly didn’t save a good portion of a backup from a few years ago. 

TL;DR: Just wondering if there’s any way to open this video file I linked. When I click on it, it just gives me the options to “react” to it. Nothing else.",0

"Did I change a setting to make my screen wake when I pick it up? Where’s the setting? IPhone 7 on latest iOS. Recently my phone has been waking the screen when I pick it up.  It happened since updating to the newest iOS.  How do I turn it off?  I can’t find the setting.  I can replicate it by lifting the phone and turning it.  


Note:   At the same time I updated the iOS, I installed a new battery, which sent me down a rabbit hole of additional problems.  The vibrate is very wonky.  It hits very hard and for calls or texts or anything for that matter, it only vibrates for like a tenth of a second and then stops.  It also vibrates for different functions like toggle settings, which I don’t think it did before.  I’ve even found a setting that says disable all vibration on this device, and even when enabled, I still get vibrations.  I’ve tried disabling haptic and 3D touches.  Still get vibrations.   I think this is unrelated to my original question, I’m just providing it to be thorough and describe that it was both the battery upgrade and iOS update that my problem with the screen began.   I’ve also replaced the Taptic Engine and it did not solve my vibrate issue, so I think that could be a bigger issue.

"iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful.  

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*iPhone 8 Plus running 13.5.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

2 years ago, US, AT&amp;T store. Currently on a monthly family plan with AT&amp;T. Other 2 iPhones (X, and 7 Plus) have no issues.

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

This is my daughter's phone so it's hard to know for sure when it started or why.. She mentioned continuously getting prompted for iCloud password and also that it wasn't working (but not sure she knows it for sure). She also mentioned something about a number she didn't recognize when she tried to reset her password for iCloud.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I have tried pretty much everything I found on the internet..

* Reset Network Settings
* Reboot iPhone
* Disabled iMessage, FaceTime, signed out of iCloud, waited over night, signed in to iCloud, tried to activate iMessage and it failed.
* Erased phone and restored from backup
* Tried just on LTE, just on WIFI
* Reseated the SIM card

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

What's weird is when you go into Settings &gt; Messages and you hit the ""Send &amp; Receive"" under iMessage.. On mine it shows my apple id at the top, grayed out, then under ""You can receive imessages to and reply from"" it has my phone number (grayed out), my icloud account, and my gmail account.. It has a check mark by all of them

On hers, under the you can receive she has her phone number and her [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) account.. Only the icloud account has a checkmark.. When you try to select her phone number it spins for about 3 seconds and then nothing happens..  No checkmark.. 

Not sure what else to try..

"Pretty sure my iPhone X officially died tonight... is there any way to get my info off of it? 1. iPhone X running what I’m guessing is the newest iOS as I update it routinely.

2. I think I purchased the phone in February 2018 so warranty is long gone.

3. So today at the pool I was taking pictures of my boyfriend and baby in the water and I got it wet briefly. I didn’t really think of it as a big deal because I’ve definitely had it in the water the first summer I had it and taken pictures. But then all of a sudden the screen turned off. I didn’t think much about it because the apple comes up on the screen. 

So when we get inside from the pool the screen has the apple comes up and will go back off &amp; then I got the support.apple.com/iPhone/restore screen. I hard restarted it &amp; it came up again, but then when I plug it into my laptop iTunes doesn’t recognize it as being plugged in so I can’t restore it. I just went ahead and ordered a new phone to be picked up tomorrow because my phone is critical for work. I’m guessing that my X is completely toast &amp; I have it set to backup to iCloud but I can’t really figure out how to tell when the last update was? I’m assuming everything that I did on my phone today is gone (including the photos from the first time my baby went swimming which I’m now an emotional mother about) but how can I tell when my last back up actually was? 

Face ID stopped working about maybe a year or so ago, I attributed that to my having dropped the phone quite a lot (thank god for a strong case!) and knocked something out of whack. I’m guessing when it got wet this time it just ruined something and it doesn’t want to work now.

I haven’t tried anything other than hard restarting the phone twice (put it in a bag of rice now, but the phone actually seems to be turning on if the apple is showing up??) and plugging it into my laptop but that’s all. I’m open to any information about how to possibly get the phone restored so I can continue use, or how to pull any pictures from today off of it possibly. I guess I’ll finally start uploading my photos to the cloud - this is what I get for not doing it!

"How to put iPhone 4 in Recovery or DFU mode with no home button I have an old iPhone 4s that I'm trying to reset. The home button is broken and the PIN/password is forgotten.

The normal way to factory reset an iPhone 4 is to hold the home and power button down, but the home button is broken so I have to find another way.

But those apps did not work because reiboot couldn't do it without me entering the PIN, and recboot only works in a 32 bit OS (Mine is 64 bit Windows).

"Can I Hide or Block the Voice Memos app? Our young daughter has voice memos on her iPad and she is over the top obsessed with yelling and screaming at it to see how the bars change with her voice. At first, it was cute how interested she was in seeing how her voice changes the sound waves, but now it’s our least favorite thing. We let her use her iPad twice a day- in the early morning when she gets up before us, and for an hour during the day for “quiet rest time.”  (Yes, she has other toys and things to do... she mostly uses it to play a couple little SagoMini games... parental controls are on...) We have told her to stop yelling at it, and she will... until she remembers she has the app and starts doing it again. 

It’s gotten to the point where she uses it so much that not only is it driving us insane, her “memos” are taking up all the space on her iPad.  She has well over 1000 recordings and sometimes just doesn’t hit the end recording button so she’ll have 7 hours of just random talking throughout the day.

"Error 14'd, can I restore and then restore from backup from iOS 13.5? Hey all. Here's what happened. My phone said it was full. ""Other"" was 10gb. I deleted some pics. Still full. Other was now 13gb. I deleted 400 pics, 5 huge chat threads, 8 100mb+ apps. Other was 18gb.

"One contact, can't get texts and calling goes to voicemail - contact not blocked My friend's (let's call them Friend A) iphone SE has an issue where they can't get texts from a specific contact (Friend B).

I tried walking A through checking to see if B is blocked, and the B is not blocked on their phone, nor on their Verizon account. 


Does the text and voicemail situation indicate B could have their number blocked by mistake? We've all talked about it and B says it isn't the case, nor would it be intended.


Could it be a bug of some kind? Any search results point to a blocked contact, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here.

The glass on the front got broken where the top third of the display doesn't seem to register human touch. This is a problem because the 2 and 3 don't work in the dialpad when trying to unlock my iphone. 

I have one of those female USB-to-lightning adapters the try to hit it with my PC keyboard, but the iPhone reads this as an Accessory that needs to be unlocked to work.

Apple stores are closed, a call to the support line didn't yield much, and Best Buy was only able to tell me about replacement options. I have some photos I'd like to grab but I didn't sync my photostream with iCloud previously.

The camera app is currently grayed out, meaning the phone must have restarted once. That might be a blow to some solutions (like my adapter detailed below).

1 - is there a method to get the passcode entered that I have not thought of yet? I'm willing to scrape off glass if needed to hit the numbers in mechanically. I also tried to use screen mirroring with Reflector software but I can't drag down the Control Center because the top third of the screen is kaput, meaning no ability to Mirror.

2 - If not 1, is there a way I can remotely grab my Photostream through icloud with the device locked?

"Problems detaching disabled App Store account from iPhone? Hey guys I hope someone here can help me out. Long story short my  iTunes/App Store account that I’ve used since 2008 has been disabled.

"Help with Google photos + New iPhone Hi friends. I just upgraded to the iPhone 11. I haven’t restored my backup from my old device to it yet because I sort of don’t want allllll the shit from my old phone on my new one - I want a fresh start! But I have a question regarding my photos. 

I use google photos and all my iPhone pictures are backed up there. Is it safe for me to delete all my iPhone photos on my old device, so that when I sign into iCloud on my new device, they aren’t downloaded onto my new phone? And then maybe I don’t even need to restore the old back up, I can just start fresh and re-download my apps manually?

"Some songs don't appear on my iphone music library Im a complete newbie to iphones, only used to own android phones. So what I wanted to do was transfer the music I have on my computer to my iphone 11. I read on their website the tutorial to do this and did the following:

1)Downloaded itunes

2)Drag and dropped all the songs I wanted to transfer to the itunes library

3)Connected iphone to computer via usb

4)Clicked on the phone icon on itunes, which led me to a page with all the info of my iphone

But when I go check the list of songs the iphone has, both on the itunes and on the music app on the phone, there have been some that successfully transferred,but also many many songs that are missing.

I dont know what went wrong. Is it because Im not subscribed to apple music?

It is only painfully slow on my home wifi. Everywhere else it works great! My friends network even works fine and we have the same isp. Could it just be a compatibility issue? Is it my router?

"My Iphone 8 dies for a couple of days up to a week when I'm close to a welding machine, I'd love to know why. 1. iPhone model and iOS version

I'm not very interested in phones or up to date with models and releases but I'm pretty sure it's an Iphone 8 plus and it probably has the most up to date iOS

2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

It's my work phone, I didn't buy it. I live in Sweden but this has so far only happened to me and my colleagues while working on a project in Germany.

3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

Today I saw it happen in front of my eyes, I pulled up my phone to take a picture and as I was about to snap the picture the screen just started showing thin white vertical lines on a grey background, the screen became brighter and brighter for thirty seconds until it went all black. It reacts to no buttons, nothing happens when I put in the charger, when I ask someone to call me it's like it's turned off. But last time it happened to me and to most of my colleagues, it will just start working in a couple of days again.

It occurs when we weld. At a certain stage of my job we have a 10 hour shift where we TIG-weld copper. It is somehow related to that because it always happen during that shift but while I'm annoyed I'm dying to know the exact cause. We only have DC in our TIG torches when welding copper. It's a fairly powerful welding machine able to output upwards 450 Ampere required for copper welding.

4. What caused the issue?

I'm not sure about the exact cause. Today when it happened the welding machine was turned on standing maybe 1,5 meters away but noone was running it since maybe 30 minutes. 

5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

Me and my colleagues try to not wear the phones in our pockets while we weld. We need to be able to take photos and to be reached, so I still kept them around, so I guess at this point a solution to have it not happen in the future is to keep the phone in another building as we do this but that's annoying.

6. Any other information you think might be useful.

We think it's only these newer Iphones it's happening to. But it also only happens when we're in Germany. Maybe that's all a coincidence but it's just so weird. I moved the SIM-card to another, older Samsung phone, and it's working fine. Maybe it's relevant, the item we weld is high voltage DC conductors for power transmission.

Does anyone have any ideas what it might be doing this, or how I could get my phone to start working again right away?",0

"High Data Usage My mother downloaded an app called ""Planet Cam"" and it used 53GB mobile data in just a few hours. That is just insane and as far as I am concerned only possible if many videos are continuously being played back at the same time.
Moreover, she only used it a few short times within this period.

I have read about an iOS bug, but it is just this one app, acting up and not a high usage overall.
Does anyone know about this app? Or about what could be the reason? Could it really be iOS that is causing the problem?",0

"iPhone 7 Says “No Service” ?? Hello! I would truly appreciate some help with this situation i’m in right now. So my phone is 4-ish years old iPhone 7, and it’s never given me a problem until recently. I would wake up some mornings starting around a month ago and a notification would pop up that said “cellular update failed”. I wasn’t even aware of what a cellular update was or that it was happening. It would not allow me to use cellular data at all. The only solutions to this were to update the phone or do a hard reset. It would be fixed immediately, if not by the next morning. These methods have been working for a few weeks, but last night and all day today it has said No Service all the time no matter what, and that in order to use cellular data on this iPhone, I have to update, but I can’t because it’s up to date at 13.5.1. I don’t know why this is happening or what to do now, can anyone please help? Thank you!",0

"Iphone XS Max Constant Rebooting My girlfriends phone keeps rebooting for some reason. As far as I am aware it is updated to the current update. No drop or water damage.

"App cannot be downloaded Hi all,

So yesterday I deleted an app off my phone because it was glitching and I’ve deleted and re-downloaded the app onto my phone before so I didn’t think anything of it.
However, after deleting the app, I can’t seem to re-download it. On the App Store instead of ‘get’, it say ‘open’, as if the app is still in my phone. Under purchases &gt; not in this phone, the app doesn’t appear.
Any idea how to solve this issue? Thanks so much!",0
"IPhone XR storage full, “other” section growing I have and iPhone XR on iOS version 13.4.1, and cannot update because of storage. A few days ago I started getting storage full notifications, and found that more than 1/4 of my storage was being used by “other”. I tried restarting settings, clearing out as many caches as I can, deleting old files and voice memos, but I could only reduce my storage to 61 gb. The other section just keeps growing, and a day after that it was already full again. It takes up so much storage that I can’t even open up pictures on snapchat.",0
"iPhone XR Texting Freeze My iPhone XR will sporadically freeze and crash while texting within the Messages app. It seems to be worse in the evening, when I have used it throughout the day. It is limited to texting pretty much only, but I have experienced issues with streaming music on cellular data (using Spotify specifically). I have the most recent version of iOS  (13.5.1) and have had this issue through the last two versions.  


Troubleshooting done with no solution:  
Verified no storage issues (128 gb iPhone with 50+ gigs left)

Turned off background app refresh

Used Apple brand chargers and wall adapters

Removed and reinstalled a multitude of apps

Reset iPhone and restored from backup

Restored iPhone straight from backup (trying to avoid starting all over again)

Turned off push notifications for email and other apps  


The iPhone is in relatively good shape and has been dropped a handful of times with a case. 

Has anyone else experienced an issue like this? It is ONLY with the Messages app, and once it starts freezing, it pretty much will not stop and texting becomes impossible. A restart has no affect on the freezes and crashing. Before I go through the effort of calling Apple or doing anything further, is there a fix for this? Anything else I can try?

The phone is under warranty, but I am not sure if Apple will do anything for an issue like this.",0
"Why does my iPhone 7 not have a passcode? I have tried looking up how to set up a passcode on iPhone 7, but I just can’t seem to find the “Touch ID &amp; Passcode” option in the settings. Does anyone on here know how to set up a passcode? Thanks!",0
"Stepdad forgot his old iPhone 5's password and got locked out, is there any way he can access his images? Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

My stepdad had an iPhone 5 quite a long while back, and then upgraded to the 6 I believe, and now the 11.  He still has this old device and has a lot of images on his phone of their trip to Arizona among other things.  Is it possible for him to get access to his images?

&amp;#x200B;

We've extensively been trying to get his old photos of fishing trips in South Africa off of old hard drives, but those seem to have all failed.  Just trying to get him access to that again, it doesn't seem very likely but I figured I would ask.

"iPhone 11 screen problem Hello this is an iPhone 11, which I had bought over 7months ago, I've been gaming on it on and off ever since March and I have been left with those pesky smudges which never go away, no matter how much I wipe using water and/or a soft cloth.

This is how it looks when I wipe it with some water

the partial area somehow appear to be hydrophilic? now. I mean water slides off easily from the other parts of the screen like it should however it simply stays on those spots as if something that had once been there repelling water is not there anymore? I'm not sure at all.

That part also feels a bit coarse and less smooth basically, and sometimes makes a sound that say a cleanly wiped wine glass would if you'd rub your finger against it",0
"iPhone videos are turned into audio tracks when trying to move them to my Windows computer Hey. I’m having some trouble with my iPhone recently... I’m using an iPhone Xs on iOS 13.4.1. This was an iPhone purchased from Luxembourg last December (2019).

For some reason, some of my videos become audio tracks, while others are just “unable to play” when I connect my iPhone to my Windows computer, and I can’t seem to understand why. I’ve noticed though that all the videos recorded and saved from Instagram play just fine... This is confusing. I think this has been happening since I switched from my old iPhone 6 to this one, but I can’t say for sure since I only noticed this issue in March. If anyone could give me a hand with this, it’d be helpful.",0

"I got locked out of my iPhone 8+ Hi everyone.

Two days ago, my iPhone of nearly 2 years stopped functioning normally. None of my alarms rang that morning - I couldn't click on anything. I restarted my phone a couple of times only to be stuck at the Apple logo for hours. 

I did a hard reset and plugged my phone into my laptop to get it into recovery mode. I had it install an update, but my laptop suddenly went on sleep mode and lost all its progress. I was left with no choice but to restore my phone. And I did. 

After restoring, my phone prompts a message to say about 'remote management' and that a certain company (I won't name) has control over my phone. An apple tech guy also walked me through recovery mode, but we got the same result. His hunch is that this phone used to belong to that company and only decided to lock it now (and that he'll help me escalate this problem next week, but that my homework is to contact the company). I restored my phone 4 times in total that day. 

Let's just say I wasn't received with warmth by the company, and they may not be the solution to my problem. I contacted the seller too, who was happy to reply and escalate to his supplier (he has 100% rating on eBay, and I was sure at least then that I bought this phone brand new - I even checked it with my serial ID and it says I have a valid purchase date). He said he'll keep me posted. 

I guess at this point, I'm trying to think about my options (buying a new phone being the very last resort). Is there any way I can go around this, or is my iPhone useless now? (I'm located in Australia, if that's of any help warranty-wise). 

Thanks in advance.",0
"Why can’t I save photos now? iPhone XS Max, iOS 13.4.1

A week ago whenever I used the reddit app, I was able to tap a pic to open it, tap it then select SAVE PHOTO and it would be saved to my camera roll. I went to bed one night and the next morning I could still do all that but it doesn’t save to my camera roll. I have to screen shot and crop the pics to send to my sister. 

I have:

Signed out/back in. 

Turned my phone off and back on. 

Deleted the app and reinstalled. (It worked for one pic after reinstallation)

Made a new account with the same results. 

Asked a friend with a droid to try and they could save pics.

"iPhone 8 Maximum Capacity I bought an iPhone 8 (I know its an old model but I just like it a lot) almost 2 months ago and today I checked the maximum capacity of the battery and it turns out to have decreased to 96%. I try to avoid charging it overnight and charge it during the day something like 20%-90%. I have the Optimised Battery Charge switched on. 
I did not expect it to be at 100% because I use it a lot but 96% feels like a bit too much of a decrease for 2 months.
Should I be worried and if yes can you guys give some tips?",0

"What’s the deal with battery cases? I have an iPhone XR and I bought an Apple smart battery case around 6 months ago. I love everything about it (apart from the bulk) but I worry about the effects it may have on my phone’s battery. Should I keep the case on all the time? And if I do, will it degrade my phone’s battery faster? (I used to keep it on all the time and never let the case die, meaning my phone battery would stay at 100% constantly, but then I noticed my battery health went from 96% to 93% in a few months or so). So, should I keep the case on all the time or take it off?",0
"Does replacing the battery help battery drain? I have an iPhone 6 and lately the battery is draining way too fast, just typing these two lines cost two percent. I have all the battery saving options enabled, I turned my brightness to the lowest, my Bluetooth is off, my volume is off and I have battery saver on. 

This battery drain started one day when my Touch ID decided to stop working. After that the bottom of my phone became extremely hot and then I noticed that it was charging a lot slower. Then the battery started draining worryingly fast.

I did some research and I came to the conclusion that I should replace my battery. I don’t want to waste money and replace it just for it to not fix anything, so I wanted to know if it would fix the extreme battery draining if I replaced my battery.

TL;DR Phone battery draining quickly, would replacing battery fix my problem?",0

"Intermittent cell signal loss. Apple blames carrier. Carrier blames Apple. Frustrated. **Summary of issue:** Several times per day, my iPhone 11 Pro will suddenly completely lose cell service. It’ll go from 4 bars to 0 bars, during which time I can’t place calls or use cellular data. This happens in several different geographic locations so it’s not a signal issue. Furthermore, my work phone uses the same carrier and doesn’t have these issues. After a minute or two, the service returns and it works like usual. 

**What I’ve done to try to fix it:** My first move was to call Apple since I have AppleCare+. Apple had me take several troubleshooting steps including checking for Carrier Setting Updates, Resetting Network Settings, and erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. None of these solutions fixed my problem. 

Next, they had me call my carrier (FirstNet, which uses AT&amp;T towers). My carrier reprovisioned the phone, and then sent me a physical SIM card to replace the eSIM which I had been using. Neither of these fixed the issue. 

Back to Apple, who me install a profile to collect more detailed Baseband logs. Engineers at Apple still blame my carrier based on the logs. 

I’ve been having this problem for over a month now. I told Apple I’d like a new phone since I think it’s pretty clearly a hardware issue. They warned me repeatedly that I’d be charged the full retail price of the phone if they aren’t able to replicate the issue. This issue is so infrequent that I seriously worry they won’t be able to reproduce the issue and I’ll be screwed out of $1,000. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",0

"iPhone 7 recover photos/videos after Reset procedure possible? Hi,

I consider myself tech-oriented, have a lot of experience with tech gear, software, computers etc. Just to clear that line out.

Now, I don't personally use iPhone, my colleagues and friends around me do and I have limited experience, e.g. performed setup and registrations for friends in the past, installed few apps and so on.

And one important friend just had a **weird accident with her iPhone 7**. The internal memory was full, she cleared few old photos and videos to make some room for new ones, and decided to **restart (reboot)** the phone to see if it will make it run smoother.

And that's when the problem occurred. The phone shown a message that it is now **locked and to connect to iTunes to unlock it**. That message does not happen unless you make a mistake **10 times to try to unlock it (brute force protection)**, but she **denies** that that ever happened. It's her own phone, not stolen one obviously, and she **never changed her password** in the last 3 (or 4?) years.

Anyhow, she gave me the phone to try recover it, since her laptop is some ancient one on Win 7 and iTunes no longer works properly there (phone requires newer version).

I installed iTunes on my Win 10 laptop, everything went fine, phone was started in recovery mode, but during the ""update"" recovery procedure (non-destructive) phone stopped the update process, and iTunes reported that it cannot be updated because of an unknown error.

Ok, next thing, the only thing left, really, was factory reset via iTunes, I entered all the Apple ID and unlock pin credentials, and it was done.

**Phone is now factory clean. And it works 100% fine. But it is empty :(**

\*\*\* She DOES NOT have: \*\*\*

**1) any iTunes backups**

**2) iCloud or other cloud backups (iCloud was off)**

**Is there a \*\*\*beeping\*\*\* way to recover some photos and videos from her phone?**

AppStore is useless (US country), when I enter ""**photo recovery**"" in search, I get the whole crap apps in there. I'm all Android, at least we have **DiskDigger** and tons of other options (in particular, if we have external memory card storage).

Any, and I really mean, any app for Windows that advertises like crazy on Google for iPhone recovery is useless, since they either find no photos at all, just calendar and similar things (unimportant) or require **iTunes/iCloud backup** something. I have tried at least 10 of them, and traditional apps like Recuva and alike do not see iPhone as a storage device, since it's mounted like a media something crap (MTP device).

Sorry for the long post, but my Saturday is ruined anyway, and is there any way that really works?

I got an idea to use **iExplorer** to mount it as a **FAT32 Windows drive**, and it was like hell hard to find a matching iTunes version that will work with iExplorer properly, but it was a no go, either. Software like **Recuva** complained about unrecognized file system, and **Stellar Phoenix** *something* successfully scanned it (in like 5-6 minutes, which was odd), but didn't find a thing. It's a virtual device driver that goes through iTunes, so it was a long shot anyway, but still... pity.

I can run a **Linux Ubuntu** disk, but not sure how the device is going to be mounted there and what recovery apps options are available. Does anyone have any idea in this regard?

Any idea?

BIG thank you!",0

"Iphone XS Stuck in Restart Loop It randomly started last night, my XS would stay on for about 5  minutes and then randomly restart. I decided to put it into recovery mode and reinstall the OS thinking it was an issue with the most recent update.

"iPhone X won’t start up. Stuck on Apple logo. Hello, I am looking for some help with my girlfriends iPhone X. 

First let me give you the details,

It’s an iPhone X, not sure on the firmware. I think it was 13.3. I bought it from my friend second hand for her but there weren’t any issues other than the back glass being smashed. Haven’t had any other issues with the phone until today. Hasn’t been dropped, no water damage and haven’t tried to update it and anything happen midway through so I’m at a loss to the problem. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning to her phone not turning on after being on charge overnight. I have tried the hard reset as well as recovery mode and dfu mode but her mac doesn’t recognise the phone when it is plugged in but it recognises mine so the problem lies with the phone not anything else. 

When plugging into the wall to charge it gives the battery charging indication and then starts to boot up with the Apple logo but won’t go past that. It will sit on this screen forever.

Basically I’m just wondering if anyone experienced this or has any advice of what to do next. 

I spoke to Apple support but they only told me everything I already knew then gave me a quote of £600+ to fix it which is ridiculous when I only paid £100 for the phone. 

If there is nothing I can do then she’ll just get a new phone but if it’s possible to fix it I wanna give it a go. 

Thanks in advance for reading my post and if there’s any info I missed out please let me know!",0
