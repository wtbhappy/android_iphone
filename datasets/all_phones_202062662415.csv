hfr5q6,"Strange giggling sound coming from Galaxy S10+ Like the topic says, I've heard a faint giggling sound coming from my S10+ a couple times today. It happened once while I was briefly on the Tumblr app and again I believe while I was on Chrome. There was no indication from the notification bar indicating which app it could have potentially come from and it only lasted a second or two, so I didn't have the time to screen record it.

I tried researching the potential cause of this and found a small handful of similar posts from the past decade but no real diagnosis of the problem or solution to it. I don't do any shady browsing on my phone and the only apps I have that didn't come from the Play Store are Tachiyomi and Blokada. I've run scans from both Avast and Malwarebytes and neither have found anything.

What should I do? Do I just need to do a factory reset or can that be avoided?

hfkkil,"My phone only charges from a laptop and not the outlet I have a Samsung Galaxy A50 and this started to happen yesterday. 

I have tried cleaning the charger and the phone's port with no succes, also changing the charger, but it still would only charge from the laptop.

There isn't anything visibily wrong with the port or any of the chargers. 

I did charge my phone on an outlet that is a bit broken and it might have accidently given it too much power and fried the charging port... so maybe that's the reason but I don't really think so since it still charges from the laptop

hfu22b,"Air Command not working with S Pen on Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Hey everyone, 

I've got a trusty Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 which I've had from new for about six years. Never dropped, always been good - had some issues with the battery and screen flickering, but I flashed it with TeamWin and updated to Marshmallow (currently running Android 6.0.1) - I did this over a year ago and have had no issues.

I use Smart Launcher, which I greatly prefer over TouchWiz.

So that's the background.

Everything has been working fine, and as far as I can tell there has been no updates. But now, when I pull the S Pen out of the dock, the tablet makes it's 'Whoosh' sound - but no Air Command. I press the button on the S Pen - nothing. However, I do have the floating dot on the screen that indicates where the S Pen is pointing, and the S Pen is functional - if I were to edit a drawing, for example, I could do it entirely with the S Pen.

I've tried rebooting, wiping the cache, but it hasn't worked.

Also - and this may not be related, but I'll add it in anyway - the soft touch button on the left of the physical home button has stopped responding. When I press it, it lights up, but normally it would bring up a screen of active tasks, but now it does nothing. The back arrow soft touch button works fine.

Second also - when I drag the drawer down from the top of the screen, there is the settings cog - pressing that does nothing.

Those last two are minor annoyances that I can live with - the Air Command is something that I would like back!

Any ideas?",1,0,,0,1,n900-in-car,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/hfu22b/air_command_not_working_with_s_pen_on_galaxy_note/,0,2020-06-26 04:59:51,1593118791.0,1

I'm  looking at a new android phone for under $600 CAD. I've narrowed it  down to the Xiaomi Note 10 and the Realme X2 Pro. They are both the  exact same price where I live. I'm pretty torn between them because the  Xiaomi has better cameras (but how much better??), but the Realme has  better performance and a 90hz display.

If anybody owns either of these phones, I'd love to hear your experiences with them.

I don't do much gaming, but I'm hoping to keep my phone for at least 2-3 years.

I  don't play graphically intensive games on my phone, so I don't really  care if I get Ultra settings. I'm just not sure whether or not the 730G  is fast enough for normal use.

I checked and both phones support all bands of the network that I'd be using.

I have a decent understanding of general Android development. However not sure where to start on how to build this type of camera component. Is it something I might have to partially build in unity to get the sphere mapping and then link in the android camera to capture? I have no experience with unity so not sure if this is even a thing that is possible.

hf8p0h,"Factory Reset After Using Market Helper, Now My Device Is Permanently Labeled a Nexus 5 After I booted up my GPD XD with LegacyRom, I used an app called Market Helper to spoof my device so that the Play Store would see it as a Nexus 5 so I could download an app it claimed wasn't compatible. Shortly after I ended up just factory resetting the device, but even though the app claims it would go back to normal if your device was turned off, its still stuck saying it's a Nexus 5 under Model Number in the settings. I even tried completely reflashing the LegacyRom disc image and it still didn't fix it. And I'm not certain about this but I think it may also be the reason my GPD suddenly refuses to connect to my wifi now, always saying ""Authentification problem"" now, ever since I factory resetted it. It'll only connect to my phone through mobile hotspot.

I tried holding the button to reset again, no luck. So, I held it for a really long time and maybe pressed the volume buttons. Next thing I know, the phone boots up again but did a factory reset.

It told me to log into wifi because an unauthorized factory reset was performed and I needed to prove my identity. So...a factory reset can be done by anyone? Why wasn't I asked to confirm after logging into my Google account? Anyway...

hey3o9,"Dorling Kindersley Visual Dictionary — Obtaining a text version of app data  

I'm terrible with technical terminology and not fantastic with  technology generally. I've tried a few searches in the forum and nothing  came up with the search items I was using so apologies if this has been  asked already.

I have a series of visual dictionaries for various languages I am  fluent in/studied or are currently studying that exist as both physical  books, PDFs and an app on my Samsung. The app allows you download the  audio for every entry in the dictionary (roughly 6000 entries) in your  chosen target language and then use the dictionary via the app.

For reference, the app is called ""DK Bilingual Visual Dictionary""  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dk.bvdaudioapp&amp;hl=en\_AU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dk.bvdaudioapp&amp;hl=en_AU)

What I am currently working on is putting together an excel  spreadsheet so I can create a deck on my flashcard program for my own  use. The spreadsheet/flashcard has a field each for \[English\], the  \[Target Language\]s (a column/field each for each language.) and \[Audio\].

I have worked out how to access the audio files but what I now need  to do is have a list of all the \[English\] and \[Target Language\]/s  entries and correlate these to the audio. Unfortunately, the audio files  are titled along the lines of:

DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis010diemen\_001.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_002.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_004.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_007.m4a

They are separated by chapter (the numbers in the middle) but there  is no real logic with the ordering (the final number of the file name).

Also, to obtain the full list of entries, I will need to take screen  shots of each page on my Android phone or on my iPad and then run this  through my OCR software.

What I am hoping is that there is a way of somehow accessing the text  of an app and I can then manipulate the data on Excel. As an example,  something that might read:

{{English:Dog}}blahblahblah{{German:Der Hund}}blahblah{{Audio:DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis010diemen\_001.m4a}}

As you can see from my use of ""blah blah"" for technical speak, this is way beyond my limited IT skills ;)

The only alternative is to then listen to every sound file in one  target language, compare against the english audio and then refer to the  audio file name although fortunately I should only need to do this one  as the file names are the same in every language.

For reference, I have paid for the books, have purchased a few  E-Books and have downloaded the app and this is solely for my own use.

het6ml,"Android 4.2.2, LG Smart TV, and Netflix help This is going to be a convoluted one, but here goes. I bought a used LG 6400 Smart TV a while back. It runs on a modified version of Android 4.2.2 (you can actually get to the Jelly Bean Easter egg on a TV!). There's a built in Netflix app that works well with the remote.

Recently, the Netflix app has started loading, before hitting a blank white screen that says ""file not found."" I have tried unplugging it, connecting to different WiFi, clearing the cache, disabling and reenabling, and even factory resetting the TV. 

Because it's on Android, there's a Google play store, but downloading Netflix bizarrely gets a different app. The downloaded one has a white logo, instead of the TV's default red one, and doesn't work at all with the remote - you have to use the pointing feature like it's a Wii remote.

Basically, I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas that could help get this built-in Netflix app to work again?

hei99y,"How could I stream my phone over wifi, to my PC, with no root, and with Remote Control. Hey. Before I had my current Zenfone 6, I had a samsung s6. With it, I could use an app called SideSync that samsung provided, which allowed me to stream and control my phone from my pc.

I was wondering if it's possible to do that with any android. I play this game called Fate/Grand Order that doesn't boot up when the phone is rooted, so traditional options didn't work. USB Debugging will stop the game from launching too, so I must do it over Wi-Fi.

The game is a pain to transfer over devices so I don't want  to switch to an emulator either. I want to simply stream my phone's screen to my PC, and have control over it with the mouse.

I know this is perhaps too much to ask, but I don't want to pay for this service either. I know of some apps that allow all this if you pay for the premium versions, but I don't trust them to work.

her7tw,"Why, oh why, does Android's WiFi tethering go around the phone's VPN, even when you have ""Always on VPN"" and ""Block all non-VPN traffic"" in the VPN settings? I use a mainstream US VPN provider just for a tiny amount of anonymity on the web, and so my cell provider can't see every site I go to. I just feel like that's an invasion of privacy. I also figured that if I tethered another device to my phone, it would just look like normal traffic from my phone. I used to use it on my home internet, too, but I don't have that now since I'm traveling.

But today, quite by accident, I learned that the WiFi hotspot feature on my phone is ignoring my VPN connection! I ran a speed test on my tethered PC just to see what I get and was alarmed that it said ""AT&amp;T Wireless"" as my provider instead of some random ISP name my VPN vendor uses. If I search ""my ip"" on both my phone and PC I get different results. 

Why is this possible? Why does tethering traffic go around the VPN? 

I've been tethering like this for months. Ever since I learned that I can get full speed if I tether a DD-WRT-equipped router to my phone instead of my other devices directly. If I tether my devices directly, I get capped at 128 kbps speeds. Presumably because Cricket can figure out that they are not requests from my phone. I knew about PdaNet for a long time, and that gives me full speed, too, but it's flaky, I would have to reconnect a lot, and only works for some devices. I tried using my router in split client-router mode for a reason I can't even remember and was really surprised that doing so gave all my devices full speed. So now I have my tablet, PC, and even my Roku tethered to my phone through my router. I figured since my phone used the always-on VPN with ""Block non-VPN traffic"", I was fine. :(

So, now I'm worried that my provider (which is actually Cricket which uses AT&amp;T networks) is going to catch on that I've been tethering. They supposedly only allow it with ""compatible phones"", and with a 15 GB limit. (I think you can pay for more *a la carte*.) I used over 100 GB of tethering just last month. It's not unreasonable to use that much as a heavy phone internet user with streaming video, heavy reddit app usage, and miscellaneous downloads, so I figured my VPN gave me plausible deniability. Well, not any more.

(I can use OpenVPN from within the DD-WRT firmware to negate the issue going forward, but that doesn't really help now, since I'm sure they have logs.)

How fucked am I if they figure it out? Could they drop me without warning and make me lose the phone number I've had all my life?

Used it for some Youtube and TikTok before bed, turned the screen off and put it away. Woke up 8 hours later and it was off. Very weird, especially since when I tried to charge it I got the infamous grey circle with lightning bolt. Had to use the wireless charger to get it to charge. Now it is on again, but it was at 0% (now at 23%). When I look at battery usage during the night with the neat little graph android provides I can see that it linearly went down from 80% to 25% when I was asleep. (Strange since it was definately at 0% when I managed to charge it) It says ""no app usage"" when clicking on the graph. Does this battery have a defect?

&gt;Since you are rooted, you can try following this guide on XDA: How to Reduce the Long Press Delay Beyond its Lowest Setting. You can run the command in a terminal emulator like Termux like this for a 0.4 seconds delay: su -c ""settings put secure long_press_timeout 400""

&gt;I applied the setting with a timeout of 250, pop up menu feels super responsive (fast). 

I have a Note 8 (N950F), rooted and custom recovery. Android 8.0.0

I read a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/h9x99k/if_you_were_having_trouble_copying_and_pasting/) about customizing the ""Touch and hold delay"" which affects the time it takes the phone to pop up a shortcut menu ( like the copy - paste ..etc. when you select a text, press and hold).

In a nutshell, the settings menu does not allow customizing that delay below 0.5 seconds, need to find accessibility settings storage location in the file system, I tried searching by package name for settings app in /data/data .. found nothing.

**More details:**

I found the ""Touch and hold delay"" under settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Dexterity and interaction

it has 4 options  
Short (0.5 seconds)  
Medium (1.0 seconds)  
Long (1.5 seconds)  
Custom

When I select custom, it presents a screen where I have to touch and hold a circle for the custom desired time. The problem is any touch and hold time less that 0.5 seconds does not allow saving, only when you touch and hold longer than 0.5 seconds it lights up the save button!

I have a bluetooth FM transmitter in my car for listening to music through my phone on a car that is a little older and bluetooth earbuds.

I walk my dog a lot. I turn on bluetooth. I go outside. It connects to my car.  I swap to my earbuds. It decides I actually made a mistake and kindly reconnects to my car. I, again, choose my earbuds.

I start the walk. I make it back to my street. About 2 houses away, it once again decides that I actually want to use bluetooth in my car and automatically swaps to my car. I swap back. I walk into my kitchen, still listening to music.

""Hey, I noticed you were within one hundred meters of your car. Let me go ahead and swap to your car."" says bluetooth.

I finally give up and turn my music off.

Next day:

I get into my car. I turn bluetooth on. It TURNS MY EARBUDS ON from being shut off and connects to them instead of my car.  I manually swap back. This happens again during my drive.

I'm sitting at work. I want to make a phone call. It turns my earbuds on and decides to use those. I ultimately shut bluetooth off.

I go into settings. Silly me, obviously theres a way to turn off bluetooth automatic connecting feature on a 2020 smart phone, right?

**I have an LG Rebel 4 LTE phone running Android 8.1 (Oreo).** My problem is simple, but confusing, I already knew how to access the language and input settings to change a language, but like I said, it only told me I had English and Spanish to choose from. I decided to look for tutorials online, maybe thinking that I was somehow going to the wrong place, but even tutorials using the same exact version of android that I have had access to all kinds of languages.  
I also use the google keyboard, which does allow for Korean input, but that's different from my base android settings.

One thing I find interesting (which you can see in the screenshot I provide) is that the Spanish setting says ""United States"", making me believe that maybe just because I'm in the United States, that I can only choose languages from the United States? That doesn't make sense to me considering people from other countries move here all the time and would like to use things in their native language.

hdk6mi,"Portable sd-card filled up with Android/data folder size. Hello, I was recently notified by my phone that my external SD card was almost full. Which is odd as I only have some photos that were saved to it, not enough to fill up the entire card. About 2 months ago I switched my Amazon music app from saving music to my external SD card to internal space, this was in response to getting somewhat close to filling up my SD card with just music. This gave me back quite a bit of space. Thing is, recently with the alert of being full, I noticed it was not photos or anything I chose to put onto the card that was taking up space. According to the Samsung My Files app, the SD is filled with ""other"". I looked into it and it turns out that a folder named Android is taking up a large chunk of space on the card. 

Why would the phone store app data to the SD card if it isn't adoptable, it is solely portable? Would I be safe to delete this?

My question is, due to Covid, they ran out of replacement phones and mines been wonky. Also, I take a lot of personal photos on my phone, and do other crap. Mine is also old as hell and they take forever to upgrade us. 

Talking to an IT guy they said if I felt like it since I dont have my own phone for backup if anything ever goes wrong, they are cool with me using my own phone with their sim card (which is a nano) and either using that as a backup in case something breaks or vice versa. So I was just going to get my own phone and use their sim with their plan on it. 

The problem is he warned me that not all phones work with all carriers and sims so make sure I don't grab the wrong thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't have control over the phone plan, but I know I have a nano sim, and im using an LG Stylo 2 on Verizon. Does that mean I can just buy a phone from a verizon store that doesn't have a sim card but takes a nano, pop the nano into that phone, and all should be good with my phone number transferring over?

hdd36a,"Chronic texting issues At least once a day, my phone won't send text messages until I cycle airplane mode for 10-ish seconds and send the text again.

_

RELEVANT INFORMATION:

Had this issue for many years across many Android phones: Galaxy S6 Edge+, Note 7, Pixel 2 XL, Note 9, and Note 10. Doubt it's a Samsung-specific issue because of that Pixel.

Each of the aforementioned phones ran a different version of the OS and were always updated as updates were made available. None of my phones were rooted at any point.

The device I try texting to doesn't seem to make a difference either, be it another Android phone or an iPhone, with a couple exceptions: texting from a Samsung phone with Samsung's messaging app set as the default to another Samsung phone with Samsung's messaging app set as the default never gave me problems; and I haven't had problems texting any Android phone since Google rolled out Chat features as long as both of us are using Google's messaging app as the default.

I don't always know which carrier the receiving device is on, but I can confirm the issue exists when texting AT&amp;T or T-mobile customers. It's safe to assume Verizon or any other carrier would behave similarly.

The issue also occurs whether the recipient's device or my device are connected via Wi-Fi, LTE, or 3G.

My mobile carrier is the only constant. I've had the same T-Mobile USA account for the duration of my time with Android phones. In case it makes any difference, I switched T-Mobile rate plans once about two years ago.

I've tried all reset options like holding down the volume and power buttons but its not showing me anything in the screen after that either. Just that it's rebooting and it goes back to the same full color screens. It seems to be recognizing my face still when I look at it. The phone seems to be on and functioning normally besides the screen.

I can't seem to find anyone who's had this issue before. Any ideas on what I could try? I'm really confused.",2,0,,0,2,notgoodwithmoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/hd5bu5/samsung_a50_unique_display_issue/,0,2020-06-21 19:18:11,1592738291.0,1

But, why doesn't Instagram, instead of talking to the phone camera directly, talk to the camera app on this phone, I understand that would be a very big hassle again, but it will have to be developed to talk to a number of apps (samsung camera app, Gcam, Huawei camera app, etc) I'm not sure how different each specific app (samsung camera app for example) from model to model, but I think they have the general same export coding (correct me if I'm wrong)? Is this because they won't be able to implement their Ai filter and such on top of it or are there other reasons? and if so, If google would to add a universal G-service that can apply AI to the export of these apps ,providing manufacturer of the mobile write the code for, to work as a middle man between the native camera app ,with all the driver support and such, and Instagram app to talk to Instagram directly without developers of Instagram having to do the heavy lifting, would Instagram accept something like this or will facebook deny giving in for google to handle such processing against giving better quality for Instagram users? also how hard would it be for google to provide something like this service? I mean from what I know apps like uber already uses similar service for location and maps

Finally, I'm not a developer but I want to understand more why the problem that there are too many android phones affects apps like instagram and what'sapp voice notes, but not other apps like apps that rely on haptic feedback for example which are different from phone to phone too. or apps that requires things that vary from phone to phone ?

Well, I bought a OP 7T Pro and I found out - because someone I know mentioned it to me - that I have the feature already installed but deactivated (I think) on my phone.

I don't live in the UK, even though my phone came from there. Does anyone (specifically from the UK) also have this feature? Wasn't it suppose to be an app?

To explain exactly, I dropped my phone in some water, basically just the upper part. I took it out quickly, wiped it up and (because I didn't know better) put it in rice overnight. That didn't do anything obviously, so after seeing it wasn't turning on this morning I opened up the back. I wiped the visible water with tissue paper and spent some time drying it with a hair dryer. I then left it open to air dry more for a few hours. When I could see no more condensation anywhere ( like on the lens of the front camera), I tried to turn it on again. 

It turned on fine, but there's an inch or so of water that got in a corner of the display area and it's visible.  I turned it back off, put it on its side on a tissue so the water would have somewhere to possibly come out. 

I asked a phone service out of curiosity if I did the right thing and they just said I should bring it ASAP - now, I don't know if it's cause of course they want to make money or just telling the truth.

The idea is simple. Like you swipe down, you bring down your notification/control center and at the bottom is a brightness slider, instead or just add an option for volume slider. Like in IOS control center. 

Now i can't use the typical iOS control center thing on my phone since I'm using OP6T android 10 oxygen os. Gesture based navigation (with swipe from left/right to go back)

I would always prefer a volume slider instead of a brightness slider or just an option to add two sliders.


The thing is, i hate using buttons, additionally i have a hard case on my phone so the buttons are hard to use.

I wish to operate my phone without any buttons, at all, i can open and close the screen, but there are times like i could adjust volume while listening to music, since Spotify doesn't provide that. 

This maybe a small thing for most people but this is exactly why i would've loved to use an iPhone 8 atleast. When you could easily access all your needs by swiping from bottom.

Its hard to imagine how everyone feels fine with this? No one genuinely cares about this? Especially those who have bad volume buttons or broken buttons. I hate to rely on buttons. This feels very, ancient. Especially when you have long phones, to reach the top with your finger in long phones is quite an inconvenience.

This is of course a very first world problem, but i guess in a world where people are trying to make everything as convenient as possible.. why not this?

It scans the QR code on the screen, thinks, then says ""You're all set"". However, my browser still sits on the QR code screen for eternity. 

So far I've tried combinations of the following, all with the same results: 

* Refreshing the browser

* typing in the ""/conversations"" URL (which just takes me back to the QR code screen) 

* tried connecting in Incognito.

But here comes the problem, which one to use.

My dad managed to drown his CAT S61(should be impossible, I know). Everything but USB port was working fine. So the phone died because he couldn't charge it.

Fortunately he is really capable with electronics and he opened the phone and found out that battery connector was covered in rust, so he fixed it, and USB works now.

hbayhg,"How is Android device being rooted or running LineageOS different from PC running ordinary PC operating system (Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, OS X)? Hello everyone! Recently my friend told me about problems with apps (mainly banking apps, but also some other apps) -- some of them refuse to perform some operations (or refuse to work at all) on AOSP-based or rooted firmwares. Some of them just check for root, while others also check for custom firmware (like LineageOS). I'd like to note that it's not like VLC on desktop that can be compiled to refuse to run as root -- these apps refuse to run if the user isn't restricted enough on their own device.

Some people say that ""itsforsecurity"" -- but desktop operating systems give you root (or administrator in Windows) during the installation process. Why are desktop versions of these same applications that don't run on rooted mobile devices, don't care about root on desktop? (although the answer is simple -- you can't demand not having root if everyone has it).

Im an active Instagram user for my brand, and i really care about aesthetics and details, so since i changed from Iphone to the Samsung S10, ive been having aspect ratio compatibility issues, every time i try to upload a 9:16 (1080x1920) image to my stories, it gets cropped in because of the 19:9 aspect ratio of the Phone.

Its so hard to pinch the photo to get it to fit in the story, because sometimes you can see a line below or above the limits of the stories and its so annoying. 

The last solution i had was that after all this time, i switched to the max res of the phones display, and i actually had it work when ever i uploaded a 9:16 photo but only on my main account, the others still had the problem, and it reset for the main one once i restarted the phone.

Maybe a month ago, Play Store app downloads (that is, updates) on my Huawei Mediapad M5 model SHT-W09 largely stopped completing. Each one that fails gets stuck at a specific percentage, which sometimes changes if I clear Download Manager data, and sometimes doesn't. The notification from Download Manager vanishes from the list at the moment the download freezes, which leads me to guess that it's crashing.

My list of pending updates just keeps growing because it's so hard to deal with.

There has not been a system update for around 6 months, so it doesn't make any sense for a system app to start crashing recently.

The tablet is very intentionally not rooted (if that's even possible), I bought it for the purpose of playing games I can't play on my rooted phone. 

Some things I have tried:

* Force stop the Play Store and re-launch it: Helps with downloads stuck at 100%, but not any at a lesser percentage.
* Stop and Clear data for the Play Store
* Stop and Clear data for the Download Manager: Sometimes helps, but not often enough. If I don't stop the Play Store this also brings up a ""can't download"" error, but that doesn't change anything.
* Stop and clear data for all three of Play Store, Download Manager, and Google Play Services, then reboot: Still happens.

So, Anyone got any ideas? I **really** don't want to factory reset, since unrooted Android has no functional way to backup my apps and their data.

haxb2u,"Phone turned off during update, now won't launch. Got my phone (One plus 5) back from a repair shop today to fix a broken screen that happened months ago.

Screen worked no problem, I'm logging into everything again and start an update. I put it in a case and it must have held down the power button as the phone turned off.

I thought it would just restart, so I took it out the case and let it do its thing. It didn't restart, but turned off, and now won't boot properly.

When I hold down the power button, the One Plus bootloader comes on for a few seconds then disappears. 

When I hold vol up+boot, I go into recovery mode with the options to: START. Restart bootloader. Recovery mode. And Power off.

When I select Recovery mode, nothing happens after the initial loading screen. When I select Restart bootloader, I'm met with ""Fastboot mode"" and I'm taken back to the recovery mode options.

When I press power off, the phone simply goes black.

When I press start, the loading screen appears, but nothing after that.

Will I be able to access my phone and the files again? I've been waiting for my phone to be fixed for so long, and to have this happen is so saddening.

Thanks in advance.

hat87j,"Video ""driver"" issues? Video apps keep crashing. Over the last few days my P30 Pro has been having issues when playing videos. Usually this happens after I watch something, then let the app run (not manually close it) when turning off the screen.

When then navigating to another app, the same thing happens. The only remedy is a restart. 
This occurs with YouTube Vanced, Netflix, Crunchyroll and WOW+.. Which are all the video apps I have, so I'm guessing it's not the individual apps' fault, but a system wide issue.
My system is fully updated, but the problem did not start with a recent update or anything. I can't pinpoint anything that would have caused this.

haossk,"how to automate or silently configure device? Hallo,

I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results.

I'd like to do some configuration after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file.

It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended, and I'd like to do the same for my family's smartphones. Android does this - to an extent - by offering to restore from a previous device setup, but this option leaves out the most (for me) tedious task: setting up multiple email accounts.

What I mean is setting up the account, WiFi, and some more like setting some particular config items for the keyboard, display, notifications, ringtones, some privacy settings, more email accounts.

I tried Google Business G Suite but (to my understanding) explicitly says it does not push sensitive information like passwords - but that's exactly what I'd want to do - fully configure email accounts including pop/imap/ssl/smtp/password settings.

Is this feasible? When searching the web I find a lot of automation tools but for operating, not for setting up.

hakb4g,"Why is the Nokia 6.1 not as smooth as my partners Moto G6, why? 
Hi All, I am perplexed by the following... The phone I use is a 2 year old Nokia 6.1 Snapdragon 630 3gb ram. As mentioned in the title, the Moto g6 which is a Snapdragon 43x is smoother (I am referring to over all response time)  and over all quicker then the Nokia. Why is this? The Nokia is AndroidOne and receives monthly updates that over time slowed down the phone, unlike the Moto. But as I remember, right out of the box the Moto was smoother and overall quicker and more responsive. I know there is more to a phone then just the specs, but can somone help me here understand what causes a quicker smoother phone?

I'm not sure if it's a generic Chinese product or a specific OEM; it comes with [MobiControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.soti.mobicontrol.androidwork&amp;hl=en), apparently some kind of corporate access application, and that makes me think it was originally intended for staff use at some office or something and might have been purpose-designed (or at least purpose-configured out of the factory).

It would appear to be new old-stock as it still has the factory protector on the screen and no scratches whatsoever.

It comes with a few basic application, but the Play Store is not present. This is a situation I've found myself in before, and what I usually do is go to APKMirror and download the latest Play Store APK as well as the latest Google Play Services. Once both are installed it usually works.

Not this time, though - I just get the ""sign in"" button that doesn't work and a three-dots menu that gets me in a very sparse settings menu if I click ""settings"" and crashes the play store if I click ""updates"".

This isn't going to be some hacky performance machine, just a light-duty tab for watching films and occasional light Internet use, so worse comes to worst I can just sideload everything off of APKmirror - but that way I wouldn't get any updates unless I downloaded everything manually every time, which I can *not* be arsed doing.

(Apologies for the formatting. I am on mobile)

So, not gonna lie, I was browsing a rather sketchy video site in chrome. No, it wasnt PornHub. It was a """"""Free"""""" video site where you could watch and download pretty much any kind of video from any website or streaming platform (YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, ~~OnlyFans,~~ HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Snapchat, etc. etc.)

As I was browsing, this download prompt from Chrome popped up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"". I already know that Flash doesn't have an Android app nor does Android does need an app for viewing flash content. So, I basically said ""FOH"" and clicked cancel. A short while later, another download prompt showed up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk"" as ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" already existed.

Obviously, I clicked cancel again, closed the site, backed out of Chrome entirely and began searching through my files. There was nothing in my downloads folder that was named ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" at all. There were, however, three randomly named ""part"" files in there which were created literally a minute before I started looking through my files (according to the details at least).

So I deleted the three part files and, to be on the safe side, I decided to revist the site to see if I could retrigger the download prompt. I know, that was probably stupid, but again, there was no ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" in my files, only the three last files. I figured that if it came again asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" then I'd know I got rid of it by deleting the part files.

But, when I went to the site again, the download prompt came up asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk."" instead. I NOOOOPED out of that again, closed the site, closed Chrome, and forced stopped Chrome.

So here is where my problem comes in.

I checked my downloads folder again and it's completely empty. I enabled ""Show Hidden Files"" and nothing comes up. I went and searched through the Chrome app data on both my phone and my SD Card and still nothing.

I opened up Chrome again and checked the download history and strangely enough, there was a ongoing download for ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" that I most certainly did NOT agree to. Chrome said that it was ""downloading"" the file and had downloaded 11.8MB out of 11.8MB. It seemed to be stuck trying to finish downloading the file, however. I watched it for like 30 seconds and it never seemed to finish. It also had the broken thumbnail icon next to it that (at least from what I've seen) comes up when Chrome tries and fails to download something or the file it downloaded is no longer in the folder Chrome downloaded it into.

There was an X next to the download that I clicked on to cancel the download, which it did, thankfully but it also just removed it from the list without telling me where it was downloading from or to.

I get that I'm probably, for all intents and purposes, fine since it looks like I interrupted it mid-download but I NEVER agreed to download this thing (Chrome didn't even let me know it was downloading the file) and that has me concerned.

I have been wracking my brain over this for two days now, and I've decided to just ask the question. 

Backstory: My best Bros birthday is this weekend, he has kids and thus cant enjoy gaming as he once did. He plays teamfight tactics and legends of runeterra.

Now the question/issue, the first game Teamfight tactics can only run on a 64bit OS. So I was looking into a Samsung tab a 10.1, but after reviews I saw it was ""64-bit ARMv8-A(32 bit mode). As I do not have any tablets with this chipset/bit OS. I am unable to test. 

Could someone explain the difference in the ""32-bit mode on a 64 bit OS"", and just a 64 bit android OS?

Also since it says 32 bit mode does that mean it has the libraries to run 64 bit apps, meaning the mode auto switches?

Sorry if this is confusing, as I don't truly understand the architecture it's difficult to ask the question.

h9yp6f,"What Causes Some Minute Brightness Fluctuations on my new ASUS Zenfone Max M2 ? So I've been having a minor problem with my new phone lately. I seem to notice a very low-intensity fluctuation on my display brightness under some specific circumstances, all related to the brightness of the colors being displayed.

One situation is when I'm typing with my on-screen keyboard and the app I am typing on is on Dark Mode (e.g Chrome search bar). Whenever I press the spacebar, a subtle ""bump"" in the brightness would happen. It's just a small increase in brightness and is barely noticeable. Same thing happens when I'm scrolling through an app feed on Dark Mode. When bright clusters of images appear on the feed, the brightness will subtly increase. This effect is also more noticeable when Night Light is turned on.

I don't have adaptive brightness turned on. I'm running the latest software for this phone. I have become a bit worried as this might not be a normal thing and is a hardware or software issue. Any enlightenment on the case is highly appreciated.",1,0,,0,1,Sydney_Born,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/h9yp6f/what_causes_some_minute_brightness_fluctuations/,0,2020-06-16 15:01:25,1592290885.0,1

h9x29u,"Texting feature malfunctioning after last update, help is deeply appreciated as I rely on this feature... Phone: Samsung Galaxy A50

Android: version 10

After a recent update, my schedule text message feature quit working correctly. I have many health issues and heavily rely on this feature to communicate with my family. If someone could help it would be so appreciated.

The problem: The texts now send at random times as opposed to their scheduled times. For example, if I would schedule three texts at 7:00, 7:01, and 7:02, respectively, they would each send at that exact time. Now they might send at 7:06, 7:15, and 7:24. Basically the pattern has been: first text sends at completely random time, then each subsequent text schedules nine minutes after the last one. 

I also used to schedule three texts at one time, say 10:00am, but instead of all sending at 10:00 like they used to, they all break up and send at random times as well. Depending on what I'm trying to communicate, it's important they get sent at specified time.

I've used this feature for years on all my previous phones and this one, never a problem until last update.I can't find anyone to help because most people didn't even know this schedule text feature existed, even though its been available for quite some time. It is not an app, it is built into android settings.

h9pq4w,"Problem with mobile networks after Android 10 update. Hello!
Since I have updated my Xiaomi MI A2 to Android 10 in January earlier this year, I am experiencing issues with my mobile network.

My carrier actually uses the network of another carrier, so in order to have mobile data working properly, a user has to:

1. enable roaming
2. turn off automatic network selection and select the carrier, which provides the network for them.

The problem appears when I want to turn the second option off. My phone returns me a message, saying: ""Couldn't find networks. Try again.""
I was able to make this change on Android 9, but since the phone has been updated, the network selection just does not work for me.

Looks like I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Another user, who owns a different phone and the same carrier  has also reported to me that he had very similar issues after updating to Android 10

My question is, whether anyone has experienced same issue after updating to the latest version of Android and if anyone knows what could fix the issue apart from downgrading the software.

I will appreciate all of your answers.

1. Dial * # 0 * # and go through each of the boxes to make sure there are no dead pixels, the screen works perfectly, the camera, and basically everything that thing does
2. (Maybe optional?) To remove all the accounts associated with the phone

4. Wait for the factory data reset to be over, then make sure the phone is not FPR locked

From my understanding the fpr lock only happens when you reset the phone from the bootloader, not from the settings; but if I did so from the settings it'll be fine.

h9ejxa,"Internal mic on Bluetooth  

Hey! I have a problem

# The problem

  
So the thing is that I have a Bluetooth headphone but its microphone is so horrible people can't understand me if I use it. So I'd like to use it only for output, and internal microphone as input on Discord.  
I know there are a lot of threads about this but either they don't work for me or there isn't any solution on it.

# Solution #1

  
I thought about installing pulseaudio but  
\- it doesn't seem stable  
\- I don't know if it could allow me to do this (could it?)

# Solution #2

  
I also thought about another solution which could be disabling external microphones making them unusable at all, but I don't know if it's possible, and if it is, how?

# Solution #3

  
I also thought about preventing Android to detect the microphone on the headphones, making them recognized without microphone.

# Solution #4

  
Or I could make an application which allow me to do it, but how? Is it possible? It doesn't seem to be.  


I'd really like to find a solution because for the moment I use WO Mic to use the phone as a microphone for the computer and make my calls on the computer, which is not normal as a device under linux should be able to do what I want without problems, computers do it!",1,0,,0,1,TheDevKiller_,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/h9ejxa/internal_mic_on_bluetooth/,0,2020-06-15 19:33:48,1592220828.0,1

h95aza,"Stolen phone still logged onto Google account however cannot be locked, located or erased A few months ago a burglar stole my phone when I was sleeping (I apparently sleep like a rock).  Now the phone is in use for some general YouTube watching by a seemingly harmless user (other than my watch history is sometimes very... strange). I was wondering if there is any way to leverage control over the Google account it is logged on to find/disable the device completely or find out the identity of the user. I imagine since the phone is still connected to the Google account it couldn't have been completely wiped. So most likely still has my data (and also my SD card). I tried to grasp at the general IPs that the account security throws out but as I am not a 'hacker' I've gotten only the district. It's a static public IPv4 domain. 
The device is a Xiaomi Redmi 7. Now thinking it *might've* been a mistake, I have also already removed the device from my Mi account.

It is a long shot and tbh I just find it hard to burn this last bridge, as the whole ordeal with the burglary and it being the first phone I bought as a functioning adult has been intense for me.

h93m14,"Kinda Nervous--Two versions of Google Photos on my Phone? *EDIT: Problem solved. It was a shortcut to the web version.*

I don't normally launch apps from my app drawer, as all of the major ones I use are shortcuts in folders in my homescreen tray.  With that said, I was browsing through my app drawer to see if I could free up some space by uninstalling apps, and I happened to notice two different Google Photos apps--one called **Google Photos**, and one called **Photos**.

I have the **Photos** app as a shortcut on my homescreen, so that one looked normal to me when I opened it.  I then opened **Google Photos** and things looked...a bit off.

There was a launch screen with the Google Photos icon on a white background (my phone is set to dark mode), and it said ""Google Photos"" at the bottom of the launch screen in Roboto Condensed, black font.  I know Google uses that font for things, but it just didn't seem ""Google official"" because I also know they don't use black text on their launch screens, and any font would be Product Sans.

Opening the app looked pretty official.  All of my photos and videos, even ones I had taken just minutes before, showed up, and the menu on the side had all of my regular account settings.  Aside from the fact that it wasn't in dark mode, everything there looked legit.

I went back to my app drawer, long tapped the **Google Photos **icon, and looked at the version.  Version 82.  The official **Photos** app I have is 4.51.0.315203446.

When in the info screen, I saw that the **Google Photos** app did say it was installed from the Google Play Store.  When I tapped that, it took me to the store, but it could not find the app.  I immediately uninstalled it, ran SD Maid, and then came here to post.

There were too many strikes against the **Google Photos** app to make me comfortable.  It had a slightly different looking splash screen.  It didn't follow the dark mode theme of my phone.  It was version 82.

I very rarely download anything on my phone maybe other than menus from restaurants, and I don't browse any sketchy websites.  The only unofficial app I have ever downloaded is the modded [QuickPic app from the XDA forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/mod-gallery-quickpic-based-4-7-4-t3790425).

This issue has to do with a group chat I am in.  There are 5 people total, including myself.

So this first started on June 8th.  After I sent a message with a Youtube link in it, I never received any reply.  Turns out they never got that message.  On top of that, when I look at that message thread, it is titled ""No recipients"" instead of their names, and in the people section there are no names, just says add or remove people.

Weird, but whatever, I just make a new group and add them all in.  It works for a time, but I am often seeing Person A join, person B Left, you have become the group leader, etc.  There are sometimes more than 10 lines of this between any text messages.  Eventually, it takes everyone out and I cannot message them in it anymore.

So I make a 3rd group, and looking at it now, there is only 3 contacts in the group, so I don't think the 4th person is getting what I am sending.  To top this off, one of the people texted me stating that she is experiencing the exact same thing as me.

h8yhvm,"-repeat- could my android have malware or been rooted without me knowing? I was looking through a younger siblings tablet the other day and I found a folder called ‘data’ then another folder called ‘data’. once you clicked it the top where the names are of the things you have been clicking is the name of a game in the format of ‘com.—whatever game—‘. the folders in the second ‘data’ folder were two folders named ‘head’ and I believe ‘service chat logs’. in the folder ‘head’ there were selfies of maybe five different people and two pictures that weren’t faces. The beginning of each of the pictures begins with either cache or cached and random numbers. two and a half years ago I used their tablet to go onto a chat app I frequently went on, since my phone was broke at the time. I can’t say for certain, but one of the photos looked kind of familiar, but as I said I can’t be for certain. the others I don’t really recognize.

When I tried to click the two files in the ‘chat service logs’ which were named that as well, I didn’t see their full names but they at least began with that. They couldn’t be opened due to I believe not having the app installed. I deleted that app on their 2+ years ago. I just wanted to bring this up because if it was from my app, why would it be under a folder that doesn’t have the apps name? also no other things were available in the data folder. I read online and saw that if you can access the two data folders that your device is rooted? I doubt a five year old could root a device, unless by accident? my other sibling took the sims card out a few months ago, could this be the reason? I just wanted to make sure there was no malware or anything that could have had access to the camera or microphone. that’s really the only suspicious stuff I saw. I believe we have always had that little box not clicked that says if we want to allow other apps that aren’t from google play. so I don’t think it was an outside app, but my sibling would sometimes play low quality games that I think were tailored to kids due to the amount of ads they would throw in. if anyone could give any insight that would be great, thanks! sorry for the repeated posts, but stuff like this scares me especially if there was the ability to access the microphone or camera without our knowledge.",0,0,,0,0,[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/h8yhvm/repeat_could_my_android_have_malware_or_been/,4,2020-06-15 02:03:07,1592157787.0,1

h8akfh,"Android vs IOS differences  

**Update after finishing writing the post\***

**This was supposed to be a short question if someone has a text in favor of android against IOS that explains good, why we you should choose an android phone and not an iphone, but combine my Ritalin and my pretty fast typing, and you shall get a super long text about why I don't like iphone users as people, what do I think of tiktok and how I learned my English. if you have 3 minutes your welcome to read. I think it's worth it lol.**

Hello my fellow android users!

I am not too deep in rooting my phone or something, but I use an android. Now, I have tried an iphone, and did not like using it. the OS is just bad.. There are a lot of reasons to choose an android over an iphone, but when I try to write them.. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can't do it.

I live in Israel (Don't Involve Politics Please...) and In Israel, if you don't have an iphone you're basically a loser.

Apple took over in the subject of phones. It drives me nuts when someone who doesn't know anything just tells someone to buy an iphone and to throw that phone in the the bin.

I am not hating on Apple but I do hate like, 90% of their users. What I find is that the people with iphones are always the basic people, sometimes I find them just less intellgient (At least in my state) Not because they are using an iphone but I feel like it says A LOT about their personality, just basic people. I also seriously find the people who use reddit in Israel (not many) to be the same kind of people who use an android.. like, it's hard to explain but that's just how it is.

Also, most of the people who use TikTok are that type of iphone people! just, less smart... idk.. I often see a video on there that shows something that I understand how it is done, or that is fake or false and no one in the comment section is getting it.. For example:

""The man who didn't eat in 40 years, and is still alive!!"" and the whole comment section is like WHATTTT how?? so cooll!!

And it's obviously not possible.. I would give many better examples but I can't think of anything right now.

And about tiktok, I do use it and I think it's a fun app, I know reddit hates tiktok but it can be really fun, the app is not bad, it's working great, and my first impression when trying it was, Ok that, that's not bad.. There are cool options, the app is smooth, works perfectly and I barely see room for improvement.

(That's if you are putting aside the crap optimization for filming with an android phone)

Oh and, to put the iphone vs android thing in perspective.. there is that kind of video with:

""ok (thumbs up) not ok (thumbs down)"" and there was one sound that girls In israel used (reacting to) and It was like, ""He is great and everything but he has bad teeth"" (like 70% of the girls made the sign of not ok)

He is great and everything but he is jealous (Most girls went with ok)

and then, ""He is great and everything but he uses a samsung"" (like 80% of the girls went with not ok)

(Not ok means not gonna want as a boyfriend)

I watched like the top 50 videos with this sound, and as I said, 80% of girls went with not ok.

This. This is the type of a personality I am talking about.

It's just like, I imagine the girl I would date in the future to be from the type of people who use an android.. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe it is just in my state, I don't really know. Maybe what iphones has become made the group of people that do use an android to like, belong to that group of people? (Which I seem to like more and want to be friends with) (Not that I hate my mom or sister who owns an iphone but you probably get what I'm saying)

Anyway, there's a dude in my class who has an iphone 11 Pro and basically acts like he a king, and he thinks there is absolutely nothing that is close to his phone in terms of, like, begin a good phone, you know. In the mind of most people today in the community in my state android=garbage (Oh and also they say iphones vs samsung, they do not know about the existence of other android phones)

I feel like I need to write a text with the benefits of an android phone over an iphone, And I truly believe there are many, but I just can't seem to ducking do it. I need to send it to him, and to know it in generel lol.

Does anybody have like a text about that? I'd love to have a link to it.

Android is great, it's better in my opinion but although I believe there are many good things to it, I can't find more than 3 words to say. I really need that for an argument, Please ? :)

Oh and again, not hating on Apple, when they do things, they often make them just magically. and they did develop some cool stuff.

Sorry if there were English mistakes, I don't listen to the teacher in my English class since about 6th grade. I am learning mostly from browsing the web\\Playing Minecraft (No joke) And I am Still better than all of the kids in my class. I needed to speak and type in English since the first day I bought Minecraft, and from begin very bad at English and needing help after school I am now the best in class, I am in 9th grade and I feel like only now I am starting to get homework that's not super easy for me and some words that I actually don't really know yet.

h8ms06,"Question About LG X Charge Hi! Sorry if this is a dumb question, I've been Googling and can't find the information I need. 

I live in America, use Cricket Wireless, and I have an LG X Charge purchased December 2018 and running Android 7.0. I just need to know whether or not this is a 64-bit device. Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, is [dropping support for 32-bit phones](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/11/pokemon-go-is-dropping-support-for-32-bit-android-phones/) at the beginning of August. It may seem inconsequential, but Pokemon Go has become a huge part of my life over the past year and a half. It's the main way my partner and I make time to spend with each other, a way we can go out and enjoy ourselves without spending money, and the cornerstone of our main group of friends. So losing access to it would be a pretty big personal blow, and I want to know if I can keep my current phone (which is just chugging along no problem, wasn't even going to replace it until next year at the earliest) or if I should start saving up now for a new one.

I'm on a super strict budget, so my phone was deliberately pretty low-end. I checked the specs of it to try to figure it out, and the LG X Charge does appear to have a 64-bit processor. But, I was told to use AIDA64 and look for ""x64"" or ""-64"" in the kernel version, and I was told my phone would not be 64-bit if it wasn't there. It isn't, which just confused me. If it's that my phone is 64-bit but my current OS isn't, is there a way that I could get my current OS to be 64-bit, or am I just out of luck? Thanks so much in advance!

h8gv1l,"Motorola One Hyper and rooting questions. I have downloaded the factory original rom for my phone.

How do i patch the boot.img file before flashing to phone?  I know of Magisk but this needs to be installed on the phone and it only patches the current boot.img installed on the phone not one on a computer before loaded to phone.

Sorry to sound like an idiot. I have rooted a phone before ( Moto X Pure )
and it worked well.
This phone tho is newer and uncharted territory for me. There were programs and such for the X Pure
when i did it. This seems to be a command (adb) process only.

Finally, is there a different logo.img I can use ( I assume this is the boot animation file). Is this done via adb commands? 

I honestly do not want to brick this phone by being stupid. When I had my other phone TWRP was a breeze but this phone will not work with TWRP.

 I found these directions and got up to this point but confused from here on

 It is the time to start Magisk Manager v7.5.1 on XT2027-3 and choose Patch Boot Image File option to create the magisk_patched Boot Image File.

10. It is essential to select the stock boot img file that you have transferred to your XT2027-3.

11. It is the time to copy the magisk_patched Boot Image File from XT2027-3 to your desktop.

12. It is essential to put Motorola One Hyper (XT2027-1, XT2027-3) into fastboot mode.

13. It is the time to install magisk patched Boot Image File on XT2027-3 using the following command.

Magisk 7.5.1 on my phone has NO option to pick a boot.img file only INSTALL and that is it

h89epk,"[Help] My mum's LG Rebel 4 shr uses through Simple Mobile upon bringing it home yesterday after an outing with my sister no longer connects to the network nor shoes it has a SIM or / IMEI number which I need to talk to her provider for help. What could have happened?! Hi all!

I've never had to post here and hope I am in the right place. But I am completely lost on how to fix my mums phone after exhausting the only ways I know of solving such an issue. 

So, long ass story as short as possible. 

My mum has an LG Rebel 4 bought through Simple Mobile as a gift. Not what I would have gotten her but I have an impulsive sister I'd like to murder right now. 

Yesterday she left and the phone was working fine. I even called her on her outing to see how she was. 

Jump three hours and I call to check on her again and get her voicemail. I now assume the battery suddenly died or my moronic sibling intentionally powered off the device. 

One hour later she comes home. I said I tried to reach her multiple times but she never got any calls and the phone was ON. 

What I found wrong and tried

She has no connection to her network. No data usage what so ever. It would not even let me turn the data properly on. It says on but I have no access to APN ( which I first thought was the issue because she never updates her phone and that was what I was trying to do as it has happened to me before). No success. Also can not update at all even when connected through WiFi. 

It can no longer  receive calls or make them nor can it send texts or receive them. Just suddenly?

So I have decided to call Simple Mobile which I am about to do but they asked in the prompts for the IMEI number. When I went to the Info for her phone there is no number listed where it is supposed to show the phone number connected to the device;  it also says ""Network Unknown"" and I briefly received a message I believe saying it could not fins the SIM (It came and went quickly.)

I have not tried a factory reset because it says all data in the phone will be lost but my concern is that if I do that all info about the phone will be erased from when I entered it to set up the phone in December. 
This is also a last resort and I have never had to do it with any of my phones or devices before. I am as you can tell not well versed in this kind of tech, I am in other areas but phones have always baffled me.

If any of this makes sense to one or some of you, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

How does this happen in the course of 4 hours?! I don't even understand it. It seems ludicrous to me. My mum is also not tech savvy and does not ""mess about"" with anything she doesn't know how to use properly first. Basically just the  browser and apps and such. 


Side note: Even as it is my mums phone my sister uses it when they are together almost daily. She deletes anything she does or tries to with little success. Could she have wiped or disconnected the phone from the network by accident?",1,0,,0,1,KatnipNix,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/h89epk/help_my_mums_lg_rebel_4_shr_uses_through_simple/,5,2020-06-13 23:17:51,1592061471.0,1

h80riv,"Ways to offer secondary verification of authenticity of an Android app I know a lot of FOSS projects publish to f-droid and that has a great system of using PGP signatures to verify the APK files.  What I'm curious about is how to verify apps deployed from the google playstore.  Now obviously PlayStore verifies the apps submitted but on more than one occasion, phishing apps that share a similar name have remained up for days.  Here are a few ways to verify the apps, that made sense to me.

1. Publish in your github repo, the full and proper playstore ID of your app
2. Publish in your github repo, the public key cert used to sign your app in playstore
3. Publish in your github repo, the full APK of your app via releases mechanism

\#1 is the simplest but isn't really cryptographically hardended.  Just makes sure the users type in the same URL you tell them to and hope there is no DNS hijack other exploits at play.

\#2 is nice since it is trivial to extract the signing cert from an installed APK and the cert fingerprint can be verified against the one in the source repo.  The signing cert never (or should never) changes so there is little maintenance this creates.  And finally, most any JDK / ADK install will be able to verify an APK against a given cert.

\#3 is probably the most complete since the user can checksum their installed APK against the one in the source repo, or simply install the one listed in the source repo.  This does put extra work on the developer since they need to remember to publish a release via github whenever they push a releast to Google.

I know it's paranoid, but there are some bitcoin Android apps that might warrant a heightened sense of paranoia.

Thoughts?

I bought a ""new"" oneplus 7 pro from a chinese reseller.  
After opening the box I immediately understood that the phone was actually refurbished (marks showing the box was already opened, charging cable not nicely packed, with signs of previous use).  
The phone is in pristine condition so I see no real problem here.

The problems came later. The phone was already booted and waiting for me to start with the setup. I set it up, everything worked fine, until I tried to start netflix which told me the phone was not compatible. I wandered around on the internet and saw that it may mean that it has been rooted or the bootloader has been unlocked. I'm not too bad with IT but I've never rooted any of my mobile devices so it's a bit outside my domain of expertise. I also saw that GPay doesn't work on devices with bootloader unlocked so I tried to set it up and it failed.

At that point I rebooted the phone, and I saw the start-up warning that the bootloader is unlocked on this phone.

Is there a way that I can put everything back as factory-settings?  
Which means re-locking the bootloader, making sure nothing else has been tampered with, that I have the default manufacturer OS, and enjoying the full-on android experience with none of the drawbacks I mentioned?

h7gohf,"Missing Google Account, can't backup Whatsapp Hi,

I got a really tricky one and I've spend hours trying to figure out what to do, though nothing worked so far.

**Basic Data**: 

* Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)
* Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop)
* Security Patch 1. November 2017

**The Problem**: The device is unable to connect to Google thus I'm unable to access the PlayStore. This is necessary since Whatsapp refuses to work until I update it to a more recent version.

Also Ive pulled some Updates and they went through flawlessly, but the phone stayed on 5.1 (saying its all up-to-date), eventhough the Internet says the J3 is upgradable to 7.1

**What I tried**: First I was thinking about readding the Google account, so I focused on that part. I restarted the device, cleared the cache of PlayStore, GooglePlayServices (GPS) and Download-Manager. Since that wasn't working I deactivated the GPS and uninstalled all updates of it reseting it to the factory version in the process. Normally this is fine as there isn't any crucial data stored in the GPS-Data. But then things got really weird. When I activated it again I recieved permanent crash-notifications of GPS. Re-Adding the Google-Account was also impossible as it just stayed at the first ""please Wait""-Screen while spamming the crash-notifications.

At that point I decided its no use and would be easier to just backup all data and reset the phone. Even more so as there really isn't much data on the phone. Just Contacts, Pics and Whatsapp.

Backing up Pics and Contacts is easy enough, but I can't get a backup of whatsapp. I managed to access whatsapp by disabling all outgoing connections and turning back the date to a date where it was still working. Once inside I turned to settings&gt;Chat&gt;Chat Backup and hit ""Backup Now"". A few seconds later it said it wasn't able to backup the chats to drive (which is expected and perfectly fine, since I just want a local Backup). The time of the last backup also got adjusted to the current time. When I checked the local storage under Whatsapp\\Backups i just hat two backups called something with settings and something with stickers, both with less than 1MB, so definetly not the chats. While looking for the Chats I found something in Whatsapp\\Databases. There was a file called msgstore.something, however it had just 6MB. Way to small to contain all chats including all media.

So I was thinking, is there some way to pull a backup using for example adb or another feature of whatsapp or Android, or is all this data lost? Also can I assume the problem to be solved once I reset the phone or can I expect the error to persist?",1,0,,0,1,S0rodon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/h7gohf/missing_google_account_cant_backup_whatsapp/,0,2020-06-12 16:11:23,1591949483.0,1

1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you.

 So I recently completely ruined my phone screen, it's just unusable. I'm about to send it off for repair and they say that I need to completely remove all pass-codes and what-not for them to be able to repair it and that I should backup any data I need as my phone will be reset during the process. The problem is that I can't get any of my files off my phone because I need to use my phone to select what I'm using the USB for my computer for and since my screen is completely broken I can't press the file transfer option and so my computer won't read it. I also can't then remove my passcode for the same reason. Is there anyway I can at least get my files onto my computer without having to press the USB prompt on my phone?

fvvcwj,"Asking Questions 101: How To Ask People For Help? There are a lot of posts on this sub with vague questions, vague symptoms, a lot of missing information and bad-explained overall. I wanted to show you how to ask a good question, from an ex-Apple iOS technician.

Here's how to ask a good question:

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*e.g. iPhone XS running iOS 13.2*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

People who answer your issue can suggest certain repairs, e.g. warranty. Country and nature of purchase also helps, since countries have different consumer protection laws. For instance, members of the European Union have a two year warranty at the point of purchase (i.e. that might not be Apple, but your local electronics store if you bought it there) - some countries (e.g. the U.K. and The Netherlands) have even longer periods consumers can claim warranty. 

*e.g. March 20th, 2019 in the Apple Store in the U.K., purchase for personal use*

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

Some issues are continuous, some are intermittent. It is important to let people know what the issue is and how often it occurs. ""iPhone restarts"" as issue, is not enough.

*e.g. iPhone crashes to springboard when opening the camera-app, this happens about three times a day at random moments. It only happens when opening the camera-app.*

**4. What caused the issue?**

There's not always a clear cause, but think about anything that could've caused it. It could be because your phone was in your pocket during heavy rain, or your cat knocked it from your desk. It could be anything.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

So people don't waste time answering possibilities you already tried

*e.g. I tried to force-close the camera app. This did not work. Then I tried to restart the phone, that also did not work.*

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

hfji7c,"iPhone 8 making hissing and crackling noises. My iPhone 8 is making a quiet, but noticeable in a quieter room hissing and crackling noise. It sounds like it’s coming from the back, just under the Apple logo. It isn’t a speaker issue.

It was doing it a little louder when I put it on its wireless charger. It isn’t the charger making the noise. 

When not charging it gets louder the hotter the phone gets during use. My guess is there’s something up with the battery or wireless charging component. 

It’s out of warranty and the battery is at 87% health. I’ve had it nearly two years. 

Is the phone safe to use? Is there a simple fix or will I have to look into making an early upgrade?

-Resetting network settings.

heoo4i,"Facetime and Whatsapp Audio cutting out and WiFi Calling not working at all? iPhone 11 Pro on iOS 13.5 Hey everyone,

I’ve been noticing that whenever i call with Facetime Audio, there will be times where the call goes silent and/or either the other person’s voice cuts off or they’ll complain i am cutting out. Same happens on whatsapp audio calls too. For Facetime especially, the audio will cut off and then come back a few seconds later but the persons voice will be very sped up (as if its trying to catch up what it missed). For Whatsapp audio calls meanwhile, only the other person will complain im cutting out but weirdly enough i hear them perfectly.

I’ve tried switching headphones and that doesnt help, so i thought perhaps it was my wifi. I’ve basically redone my entire wifi network setup (changing ethernet cables and where the modem connects to first and so on and nothing has changed). Even tried turning off UPNP and DNS servers (which were a few things suggested online) and so on. I can’t think of anything else to change. Could it be my iphone 11 pro itself?

I’m also having issues with WiFi Calling not working. My phone SIM just go back to cellular when i try to make a call with wifi calling (after waiting a few seconds in silence with no dial tone until it switches back to cellular). Also, keeping the phone in airplane mode (with wifi calling active still) will result in any call i try to make giving the “call failed” message. I also won’t receive calls in that scenario either.

I’m starting to think its my iphone 11 pro itself since everyone else at home has no issues with facetime or whatsapp or wifi calling.

My dad has an iPhone 6S running iOS 13.3.1. He didn't realize that the setting to offload unused apps was on, and as a result, Apple offloaded his password app that had hundreds of entries. The app has since been removed from the App store and isn't available for download anymore.

I think I can restore the app to my dad's phone on my own, but I'm more worried about him losing all the app info. The company who made the phone app also provided a desktop app for backing up the passwords on your phone. Unfortunately, my dad told me that he hasn't backed up the app in quite some time. If it helps, the phone app was called iAccounts, and he had purchased it for $4.99. The desktop app is called iBackup, and they were both made by the company Venticento software design company.

Is there a way to completely restore all the info the app was holding until it was removed? I know I can restore until his last save, but what about the new entries between then and now?

My touch id would give up working sometimes in last couple of months but would work for most of the time.
Today it completely gave up working. It doesnt even say, “fingerprint not recognised” or similar to show that it detects atleast, it just stays as if still waiting for the touch. 
While the home button itself works perfectly fine.
I have rebooted it several times by now, to no avail.
I have not done any screen or home button replacement. I did replace the rear camera a few months back.

Since yesterday my cute IPhone 6's display ( i know, im kinda old school and not updated) stopped working. 
I watched some YouTube videos for at least get some knowledge about it. I know what i have to repair, well said i know what i should let fix. Meanwhile i'm using my backup cellphone (Android software) and im kinda afraid to lose my whole media on my IPhone. 

Is there any possibility that my media and chats are automatically saved on my Icloud? Where can i see it? 

Can i see it through my apple ID?

Can i have again my old chats on my new future cellphone either with android software or an apple one?

I was outside working out and I put my phone on the grass for music and then it stopped cause a message came up saying that the iPhone was overheating. I immediately turned it off and put it back inside. Turned it back on maybe 20 minutes later and it started acting all crazy. I can barely type and things get clicked when I didn't even touch it. Does anyone know an easy fix to this?

Update: It works fine sometimes and then I noticed that if I have my phone on for like 5 minutes, it starts acting up again. I spoke with Apple support and they think the battery is causing it problems but to me it seems like it's the screen acting up from when it overheated the first time.

Final Update: Took it in to a third party phone repair shop and they helped me out and found that the digitizer was messed up. Ended up costing me $150 bucks.

hdafry,"Restored iPhone is disabled Phone details: 
iPhone 7, purchased in the US; carrier is Verizon. It’s got iOS 13 running

This was my old phone. I restored to factory settings some time ago thinking I might sell it, but instead I am trying to give it to a family member (my dad). 

Once the original factory reset was done, I got the white “Hello” page, thought that was good enough and out the phone in a drawer. 

Yesterday I pulled it out, charged it, and when trying to start the setup process with my dad realized that as soon as you hit the home button the phone started asking for a password. 

It does not accept either my passcode or my fingerprint, and it ended up disabled (wait for 5 minutes message).

Following guides online I have been trying to restore through recovery mode. The process appears to be going - iTunes sees I’m in recovery mode and prompts me through downloading an update (to 13.5) and accepting EULA - but at some point it stops the process and the phone just goes right back to being disabled. It’ll be plugged in and supposedly downloading the update, then iTunes drops the connection and the ‘iPhone is disabled’ message is back. 

I tried getting into DF(?) mode yesterday but wasn’t successful.

ETA: I’ve logged in to my Apple ID and reviewed all my devices, and it’s not associated with my account at all. I’ve been the sole owner of the phone, so it wouldn’t be anyone else’s account or code (and my phone code has been the same for a decade).",3,0,,0,3,sweetredthing,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphonehelp/comments/hdafry/restored_iphone_is_disabled/,7,2020-06-22 01:08:14,1592759294.0,0
hdg58u,"Main camera auto blurring photos Hey I just want to find out if this is an issue or a feature. I have an iPhone X running iOS 13.5.1. The issue that I have is that whenever I take a photo my phone automatically focuses on a certain spot and blurs the parts that it finds unimportant, I guess. For example, when I take full body photos the phone focuses on upper legs, body, and head, but from knees down it’s blurred, which I find really cool, but the problem is that this happens even if I take photos of some texts written on paper. It focuses about 8/10 of the text but blurs the other 2/10 and makes it hard to read and untidy looking. I manage to fix this only by moving away from the object (for example paper) so the camera focuses the whole thing and then cropping the background. If this is a feature, is there any way around it or do I just have to go with it? And if it’s a hardware or software error do you have any ideas on how to fix it? Thanks.

I was given the aforementioned options and chose to update. Whilst downloading the update to iTunes on the computer (not yet installing it on the phone) the phone went back to normal and I was able to do a backup to iTunes. After about 30 minutes the phone yet again went to a black screen and the restore screen came back on.

**Background** - for the last few months I've been chewing through all my monthly data allowance (10Gb) seemingly without noticing, and I'm trying to work out where/how it's happening, since the data use seems way higher than I am actually using.

I turned off mobile data on my phone about 5 days ago, and my phone provider (EE) is telling me my account has used 100mb of data since that point. 

On the data use section of the Mobile Data screen, it's telling me my apps have only used about 500kb of data, including uninstalled apps. So that would suggest:
 
a) The background app is still active, and consuming data even when the apps themselves can't use it.
b) My provider's figures are wrong
c) Someone/thing else is using the data attached to my account.

hcjnh4,"Phone contact changed area code from +44 to +32 on its own I am in the UK. I was trying to call someone 2 days ago (also in the UK) my most regularly contacted person, and it kept saying the number could not be recognized. After about 10 attempts it finally went through and I thought nothing more of it. When I was making these calls I was just dialing from the contact on my ‘favourites’, not typing in the number so there was no difference in the calls between the one that worked and all the ones that didn’t. 

Today I was sending the same person some reddit links by clicking share and then their contact and send. I then went into my messages and it shows the texts have been sending to an identical number but with +32 as the area code (Belgium) rather than +44 for the UK as it should be. 

Now, when I look at my call history it shows I had called the +32 number multiple times the other day (which explains why it wasn’t going through).  But it didn’t show this on the day, it just showed the contacts name on my call history like normal. 

It seems now that my phone is just switching between the two area codes for this one contact. Some texts I send go to +44 and some go to +32 for no apparent reason.

hcfmqc,"iPhone back camera and flashlight not working, random buzzing sound playing? Hi all,

I have an iPhone 8 running iOS 13.5.1, which I purchased early 2018 in the US. A couple days ago I noticed that my phone flashlight wasn’t working when I tried to use it from the control center (though the button responds). I didn’t really think much of it and figured it would go away after I restarted the phone. It didn’t, and around this time I noticed that the back camera wasn’t working either, opening to a black screen (the front camera was fine). I tried restarting the phone and/or closing the camera multiple times, as well as using a 3rd part camera app, but nothing worked. I sort of gave up and continued using the phone as normal. Then, tonight while  I was scrolling through reddit I heard a staticky buzzing sound. It caught me off guard but I assumed it had been from a post I had quickly swiped through, which it couldn’t have been given that it was an image. I kept scrolling for a while after, during which the sound returned twice- one after unlocking the phone to reddit, another after scrolling into a video post, on which the audio worked fine. My phone has also been slower than usual lately despite having more than a third of storage open, but I’m not reading into that too much due to apple’s love of planned obsolescence.

I’m pretty worried about this. I read that the camera issue can be caused by a drop. The last time I significantly dropped my iPhone was over a week before these issues started- it fell 4 feet onto a metal handle with foam covering, screen side down, but was surprisingly OK on the outside due to a screen protector and case. Could this have caused the issue, even a week later?

I was listening to music, casually, volume all the way up, then suddenly the volume drops down and sounds kinda muffled, when I got to the phone, I noticed that the bottom speaker doesn’t work anymore, the sound only comes out of the earpiece, I have an iPhone 8.

Here are the things I tried: blowing air into the speaker, shaking it a little bit (It may be dumb but you never know), [apple’s recommendations](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203794), water eject although it hadn’t been anywhere near water (that reminds me I had resorted to this around 2 months ago, some water had gotten into one of the speakers, or maybe both, but I eventually got it out (which again reminds me, I think around that same time I experienced something similar, only then I was on Instagram, got the phone to my ear to listen to an audio, and it was stuck on outputting from the earpiece, it worked fine after a simple reboot) I don’t know if any of this is relevant), making a call on speaker works but only through the top speaker, plugging and unplugging headphones, on and off Bluetooth, rebooting, reset settings, and only then did I remember hard reboot was an option, and since it still didn’t work, I tried it too. Finally I tried cleaning up the lightning port and the speaker grill with a sharpened q-tip, although there wasn’t much to clean.

I think the next step is to factory reset, but I’d like to see if there’s anything else I can do.

I saw a video somewhere where they had a similar issue and fixed it by deleting an app that “controls the speakers”, I haven’t installed any new app, is there a way to see which apps do that?, but I guess if that was the case resetting settings should’ve solved it?

Could you help me figure out what could’ve happened? I didn’t really drop it that day (yesterday, this happened ~18h ago), didn’t get no shock or any particular damage. It just happened out of nowhere. Could it be that something disconnected? How? Why? Or maybe the speaker is just dead and needs to be replaced ?

Apparently, while the code was verifying for quite a while, my other sibling suggests to them that they should turn the iPhone off (not shut it down completely). Now while this appears to work, the phone says it requires a 6 digit code or touch ID, but when we try to unlock the phone with the original 6 digits, it doesn't work. This of course sends the into a panic and is when I arrived home is when they tell me all this. Is there any way this can be solved without reseting the phone or is all hope lost?

tl;dr: While iPhone's new pascode was being verified, it gets turned off (not shut down).

hbxnli,"Dropped iPhone 6 and won't turn back on; battery is ok; must be hardware failure? To summarize this:

- Dropped it a day or two ago and won't turn back on, usually when this happened I could fix it by charging it and it will force to turn on. What happened when I did that was it shows the Apple logo and it would turn off again and stuck in that loop.

- Took it for repair and learned that the battery was ok and the phone most likely needed a factory reset, took them an hour to no avail but assured that it could be fixed though I took the phone anyway and went home.

- Tried iTunes and Fonepaw, usually when the recovery is about the start, the phone restarts (when in recovery mode) and then the Apple logo with the loading will show up (based on videos I've watched). This doesn't happened on me and it would just go back to recovery mode and iTunes and Fonepaw would show me error.

I got a used SE (2016) about a month ago. Battery unfortunately has been inflating, will replace soon, otherwise seems to be fine.

I just noticed my proximity sensor isn't working when on a call (edit: hasn't worked since I have it), be it a normal phone call or voip. However, the faint red light from the sensor is visible in the dark.

When I replace the battery I'll ask them to check the proximity sensor too, maybe the ebay seller changed the screen before selling and damaged something in there, no idea. But how come the sensor's red light is there when it's not working?

Also it came with a screen protector, could that be the reason the sensor doesn't detect anything? Tried with my finger too, nothing. Front facing camera works fine, screen is always clean.

hau790,"What's the appeal of wireless charging for iPhones? I have an iPhone XS and I recently picked up an Anker Powerwave pad to try out wireless charging.  So far, I'm not sure I totally understand the appeal of it.

Wireless charging:
- is slower than a high amperage lightning connection (USB Power Delivery)
- requires a more precise positioning than a wired connection (several times I've woken up in the morning with an uncharged phone, having accidentally nudged it off the pad in my sleep)
- prevents the use of other useful rear-mounted phone accessories like magnet car mounts and Pop Sockets
- doesn't continue to charge while you are using the phone (since you've lifted it up from the charging pad)

The only upsides that I can see is that you reduce the daily wear &amp; tear on the lighting port, and that placing it on a pad is somewhat faster and more convenient than reaching for a cable and plugging it in.

I'd love to embrace a wonderful future without wires, but I don't really see the upsides right now.  Am I missing something?",11,0,,0,11,chw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphonehelp/comments/hau790/whats_the_appeal_of_wireless_charging_for_iphones/,14,2020-06-18 00:09:59,1592410199.0,0

It happened since updating to the newest iOS.  How do I turn it off?  I can’t find the setting.  I can replicate it by lifting the phone and turning it.  


Note:   At the same time I updated the iOS, I installed a new battery, which sent me down a rabbit hole of additional problems.  The vibrate is very wonky.  It hits very hard and for calls or texts or anything for that matter, it only vibrates for like a tenth of a second and then stops.  It also vibrates for different functions like toggle settings, which I don’t think it did before.  I’ve even found a setting that says disable all vibration on this device, and even when enabled, I still get vibrations.  I’ve tried disabling haptic and 3D touches.  Still get vibrations.   I think this is unrelated to my original question, I’m just providing it to be thorough and describe that it was both the battery upgrade and iOS update that my problem with the screen began.

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*iPhone 8 Plus running 13.5.1*

2 years ago, US, AT&amp;T store. Currently on a monthly family plan with AT&amp;T. Other 2 iPhones (X, and 7 Plus) have no issues.

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

This is my daughter's phone so it's hard to know for sure when it started or why.. She mentioned continuously getting prompted for iCloud password and also that it wasn't working (but not sure she knows it for sure). She also mentioned something about a number she didn't recognize when she tried to reset her password for iCloud.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I have tried pretty much everything I found on the internet..

* Reset Network Settings
* Reboot iPhone
* Disabled iMessage, FaceTime, signed out of iCloud, waited over night, signed in to iCloud, tried to activate iMessage and it failed.
* Erased phone and restored from backup
* Tried just on LTE, just on WIFI
* Reseated the SIM card

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

What's weird is when you go into Settings &gt; Messages and you hit the ""Send &amp; Receive"" under iMessage.. On mine it shows my apple id at the top, grayed out, then under ""You can receive imessages to and reply from"" it has my phone number (grayed out), my icloud account, and my gmail account.. It has a check mark by all of them

On hers, under the you can receive she has her phone number and her [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) account.. Only the icloud account has a checkmark.. When you try to select her phone number it spins for about 3 seconds and then nothing happens..  No checkmark..

I didn’t really think of it as a big deal because I’ve definitely had it in the water the first summer I had it and taken pictures. But then all of a sudden the screen turned off.

I hard restarted it &amp; it came up again, but then when I plug it into my laptop iTunes doesn’t recognize it as being plugged in so I can’t restore it.

Face ID stopped working about maybe a year or so ago, I attributed that to my having dropped the phone quite a lot (thank god for a strong case!) and knocked something out of whack. I’m guessing when it got wet this time it just ruined something and it doesn’t want to work now.

I haven’t tried anything other than hard restarting the phone twice (put it in a bag of rice now, but the phone actually seems to be turning on if the apple is showing up??) and plugging it into my laptop but that’s all.

The normal way to factory reset an iPhone 4 is to hold the home and power button down, but the home button is broken so I have to find another way.

I researched and found that an app called ""recboot"" and another app called ""reiboot"" are tools that will allow me to force the phone into recovery drf mode without the buttons. From there I would be able to use iTunes to restore the phone.

But those apps did not work because reiboot couldn't do it without me entering the PIN, and recboot only works in a 32 bit OS (Mine is 64 bit Windows).

I found another app called 3utools. Will that succeed where reiboot failed?

Our young daughter has voice memos on her iPad and she is over the top obsessed with yelling and screaming at it to see how the bars change with her voice. At first, it was cute how interested she was in seeing how her voice changes the sound waves, but now it’s our least favorite thing.

We have told her to stop yelling at it, and she will... until she remembers she has the app and starts doing it again. 

It’s gotten to the point where she uses it so much that not only is it driving us insane, her “memos” are taking up all the space on her iPad.  She has well over 1000 recordings and sometimes just doesn’t hit the end recording button so she’ll have 7 hours of just random talking throughout the day.

h7yitt,"Front glass shatter = unable to unlock with passcode, or drag down Control Center Hey all, I have an iPhone X that I love. The glass on the front got broken where the top third of the display doesn't seem to register human touch. This is a problem because the 2 and 3 don't work in the dialpad when trying to unlock my iphone. 

I have one of those female USB-to-lightning adapters the try to hit it with my PC keyboard, but the iPhone reads this as an Accessory that needs to be unlocked to work.

Apple stores are closed, a call to the support line didn't yield much, and Best Buy was only able to tell me about replacement options. I have some photos I'd like to grab but I didn't sync my photostream with iCloud previously.

The camera app is currently grayed out, meaning the phone must have restarted once. That might be a blow to some solutions (like my adapter detailed below).

1 - is there a method to get the passcode entered that I have not thought of yet? I'm willing to scrape off glass if needed to hit the numbers in mechanically. I also tried to use screen mirroring with Reflector software but I can't drag down the Control Center because the top third of the screen is kaput, meaning no ability to Mirror.

2 - If not 1, is there a way I can remotely grab my Photostream through icloud with the device locked?

Long story short my  iTunes/App Store account that I’ve used since 2008 has been disabled. I never got a reason why but I’m sure I know. I had to contact my credit card company because I got billed twice for the same item on a video game app and I didn’t have time to wait for Apple to take their two weeks to sort it to refund me. 

So it sucks my account is disabled but whatever. I then took it off my iPhone and removed it from my cloud etc. I made a brand new iTunes/App Store account but when I went to install something I got the same message about my account being disabled. So that tells me that somehow something else is sticking around to identify me and stop me from making a new account. I’m sure there’s a way around this and I’m hoping you guys can help. I can’t figure out what’s stopping me from using a new account unless it’s my phone number?

It is only painfully slow on my home wifi. Everywhere else it works great! My friends network even works fine and we have the same isp. Could it just be a compatibility issue? Is it my router?

gz7352,"My Iphone 8 dies for a couple of days up to a week when I'm close to a welding machine, I'd love to know why. 1. iPhone model and iOS version

I'm not very interested in phones or up to date with models and releases but I'm pretty sure it's an Iphone 8 plus and it probably has the most up to date iOS

2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

It's my work phone, I didn't buy it. I live in Sweden but this has so far only happened to me and my colleagues while working on a project in Germany.

3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

Today I saw it happen in front of my eyes, I pulled up my phone to take a picture and as I was about to snap the picture the screen just started showing thin white vertical lines on a grey background, the screen became brighter and brighter for thirty seconds until it went all black. It reacts to no buttons, nothing happens when I put in the charger, when I ask someone to call me it's like it's turned off. But last time it happened to me and to most of my colleagues, it will just start working in a couple of days again.

It occurs when we weld. At a certain stage of my job we have a 10 hour shift where we TIG-weld copper. It is somehow related to that because it always happen during that shift but while I'm annoyed I'm dying to know the exact cause. We only have DC in our TIG torches when welding copper. It's a fairly powerful welding machine able to output upwards 450 Ampere required for copper welding.

4. What caused the issue?

I'm not sure about the exact cause. Today when it happened the welding machine was turned on standing maybe 1,5 meters away but noone was running it since maybe 30 minutes. 

5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

Me and my colleagues try to not wear the phones in our pockets while we weld. We need to be able to take photos and to be reached, so I still kept them around, so I guess at this point a solution to have it not happen in the future is to keep the phone in another building as we do this but that's annoying.

6. Any other information you think might be useful.

We think it's only these newer Iphones it's happening to. But it also only happens when we're in Germany. Maybe that's all a coincidence but it's just so weird. I moved the SIM-card to another, older Samsung phone, and it's working fine. Maybe it's relevant, the item we weld is high voltage DC conductors for power transmission.

Does anyone have any ideas what it might be doing this, or how I could get my phone to start working again right away?",20,0,,0,20,tonighttheyfly,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphonehelp/comments/gz7352/my_iphone_8_dies_for_a_couple_of_days_up_to_a/,28,2020-06-09 04:18:04,1591647484.0,0

gyo84k,"iPhone XR Texting Freeze My iPhone XR will sporadically freeze and crash while texting within the Messages app. It seems to be worse in the evening, when I have used it throughout the day. It is limited to texting pretty much only, but I have experienced issues with streaming music on cellular data (using Spotify specifically). I have the most recent version of iOS  (13.5.1) and have had this issue through the last two versions.  


Troubleshooting done with no solution:  
Verified no storage issues (128 gb iPhone with 50+ gigs left)

Turned off background app refresh

Used Apple brand chargers and wall adapters

Removed and reinstalled a multitude of apps

Reset iPhone and restored from backup

Restored iPhone straight from backup (trying to avoid starting all over again)

Turned off push notifications for email and other apps  


The iPhone is in relatively good shape and has been dropped a handful of times with a case. 

Has anyone else experienced an issue like this? It is ONLY with the Messages app, and once it starts freezing, it pretty much will not stop and texting becomes impossible. A restart has no affect on the freezes and crashing. Before I go through the effort of calling Apple or doing anything further, is there a fix for this? Anything else I can try?

gy96g4,"I got locked out of my iPhone 8+ Hi everyone.

Two days ago, my iPhone of nearly 2 years stopped functioning normally. None of my alarms rang that morning - I couldn't click on anything. I restarted my phone a couple of times only to be stuck at the Apple logo for hours. 

I did a hard reset and plugged my phone into my laptop to get it into recovery mode. I had it install an update, but my laptop suddenly went on sleep mode and lost all its progress. I was left with no choice but to restore my phone. And I did. 

After restoring, my phone prompts a message to say about 'remote management' and that a certain company (I won't name) has control over my phone. An apple tech guy also walked me through recovery mode, but we got the same result. His hunch is that this phone used to belong to that company and only decided to lock it now (and that he'll help me escalate this problem next week, but that my homework is to contact the company). I restored my phone 4 times in total that day. 

Let's just say I wasn't received with warmth by the company, and they may not be the solution to my problem. I contacted the seller too, who was happy to reply and escalate to his supplier (he has 100% rating on eBay, and I was sure at least then that I bought this phone brand new - I even checked it with my serial ID and it says I have a valid purchase date). He said he'll keep me posted. 

I guess at this point, I'm trying to think about my options (buying a new phone being the very last resort). Is there any way I can go around this, or is my iPhone useless now? (I'm located in Australia, if that's of any help warranty-wise).

gxwrc8,"Intermittent cell signal loss. Apple blames carrier. Carrier blames Apple. Frustrated. **Summary of issue:** Several times per day, my iPhone 11 Pro will suddenly completely lose cell service. It’ll go from 4 bars to 0 bars, during which time I can’t place calls or use cellular data. This happens in several different geographic locations so it’s not a signal issue. Furthermore, my work phone uses the same carrier and doesn’t have these issues. After a minute or two, the service returns and it works like usual. 

**What I’ve done to try to fix it:** My first move was to call Apple since I have AppleCare+. Apple had me take several troubleshooting steps including checking for Carrier Setting Updates, Resetting Network Settings, and erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. None of these solutions fixed my problem. 

Next, they had me call my carrier (FirstNet, which uses AT&amp;T towers). My carrier reprovisioned the phone, and then sent me a physical SIM card to replace the eSIM which I had been using. Neither of these fixed the issue. 

Back to Apple, who me install a profile to collect more detailed Baseband logs. Engineers at Apple still blame my carrier based on the logs. 

I’ve been having this problem for over a month now. I told Apple I’d like a new phone since I think it’s pretty clearly a hardware issue. They warned me repeatedly that I’d be charged the full retail price of the phone if they aren’t able to replicate the issue. This issue is so infrequent that I seriously worry they won’t be able to reproduce the issue and I’ll be screwed out of $1,000.

gxucll,"iPhone 7 recover photos/videos after Reset procedure possible? Hi,

I consider myself tech-oriented, have a lot of experience with tech gear, software, computers etc. Just to clear that line out.

Now, I don't personally use iPhone, my colleagues and friends around me do and I have limited experience, e.g. performed setup and registrations for friends in the past, installed few apps and so on.

And one important friend just had a **weird accident with her iPhone 7**. The internal memory was full, she cleared few old photos and videos to make some room for new ones, and decided to **restart (reboot)** the phone to see if it will make it run smoother.

And that's when the problem occurred. The phone shown a message that it is now **locked and to connect to iTunes to unlock it**. That message does not happen unless you make a mistake **10 times to try to unlock it (brute force protection)**, but she **denies** that that ever happened. It's her own phone, not stolen one obviously, and she **never changed her password** in the last 3 (or 4?) years.

Anyhow, she gave me the phone to try recover it, since her laptop is some ancient one on Win 7 and iTunes no longer works properly there (phone requires newer version).

I installed iTunes on my Win 10 laptop, everything went fine, phone was started in recovery mode, but during the ""update"" recovery procedure (non-destructive) phone stopped the update process, and iTunes reported that it cannot be updated because of an unknown error.

Ok, next thing, the only thing left, really, was factory reset via iTunes, I entered all the Apple ID and unlock pin credentials, and it was done.

**Phone is now factory clean. And it works 100% fine. But it is empty :(**

\*\*\* She DOES NOT have: \*\*\*

**1) any iTunes backups**

**2) iCloud or other cloud backups (iCloud was off)**

**Is there a \*\*\*beeping\*\*\* way to recover some photos and videos from her phone?**

AppStore is useless (US country), when I enter ""**photo recovery**"" in search, I get the whole crap apps in there. I'm all Android, at least we have **DiskDigger** and tons of other options (in particular, if we have external memory card storage).

Any, and I really mean, any app for Windows that advertises like crazy on Google for iPhone recovery is useless, since they either find no photos at all, just calendar and similar things (unimportant) or require **iTunes/iCloud backup** something. I have tried at least 10 of them, and traditional apps like Recuva and alike do not see iPhone as a storage device, since it's mounted like a media something crap (MTP device).

Sorry for the long post, but my Saturday is ruined anyway, and is there any way that really works?

I got an idea to use **iExplorer** to mount it as a **FAT32 Windows drive**, and it was like hell hard to find a matching iTunes version that will work with iExplorer properly, but it was a no go, either. Software like **Recuva** complained about unrecognized file system, and **Stellar Phoenix** *something* successfully scanned it (in like 5-6 minutes, which was odd), but didn't find a thing. It's a virtual device driver that goes through iTunes, so it was a long shot anyway, but still... pity.

I can run a **Linux Ubuntu** disk, but not sure how the device is going to be mounted there and what recovery apps options are available. Does anyone have any idea in this regard?

Any idea?

gxr5vz,"iPhone X won’t start up. Stuck on Apple logo. Hello, I am looking for some help with my girlfriends iPhone X. 

First let me give you the details,

It’s an iPhone X, not sure on the firmware. I think it was 13.3. I bought it from my friend second hand for her but there weren’t any issues other than the back glass being smashed. Haven’t had any other issues with the phone until today. Hasn’t been dropped, no water damage and haven’t tried to update it and anything happen midway through so I’m at a loss to the problem. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning to her phone not turning on after being on charge overnight. I have tried the hard reset as well as recovery mode and dfu mode but her mac doesn’t recognise the phone when it is plugged in but it recognises mine so the problem lies with the phone not anything else. 

When plugging into the wall to charge it gives the battery charging indication and then starts to boot up with the Apple logo but won’t go past that. It will sit on this screen forever.

Basically I’m just wondering if anyone experienced this or has any advice of what to do next. 

I spoke to Apple support but they only told me everything I already knew then gave me a quote of £600+ to fix it which is ridiculous when I only paid £100 for the phone. 

If there is nothing I can do then she’ll just get a new phone but if it’s possible to fix it I wanna give it a go.

gxptv3,"Microphone doesn’t work on iPhone 7 Hi everybody. I have an iPhone 7, software version 13.5.1, and I’m in the US. 

I had an iPhone 5 for years (I loved that thing), but my friend was upgrading and offered me her old iPhone 7. My sister, who had just upgraded herself and changed the SIM cards, offered to change my SIM cards as well, and I accepted.

Everything seemed fine, including music. And then I tried to make a phone call. No sound, and the speaker button is dimmed. FaceTime connects, but as soon as I see the person on the other end, it says it failed. I tried recording a video and when I tried to play it back, I couldn’t hear anything. This is true for the iphone camera and also Snapchat. I also tried to record a voice memo and it doesn’t even let me try.

I took the SIM card out and put it back in. I’ve restarted the phone multiple times. I’ve cleaned out the microphone area. I’ve tried to reset the phone. I even tried toggling airplane mode on and off because somebody recommended it. Bluetooth has been on and off too. Nothing has worked so far.

Hi,

I recently purchased a iPhone Xs after owning an Android phone for several years.

It's been a long time since I last owned an iOS phone and I forgot that unlike Android, iOS has a lot of limitations on what files you can access on the phone.

I am currently using iTunes and the File Sharing option to try to access files and while I can see a list of file sharing apps as well as the root directory for each file sharing app...I am not able to drill down and open any of the folders/sub directories to add or copy files inside of the folders.

I can however add or copy files and folders on the root level.

Why does Apple allow access to the root directory for each file sharing app to add or copy files or folders but then restricts us from opening the folders in order to add or copy files inside of the folders?

Kind regards,

\-Iphone 7, 128gig,  running IOS 13.5 (up to date) 

\- purchased 1 week ago via Amazon in the U.S.

First I should address I am aware of the bug causing the ""cellular update failed"" on some iPhone 7's specifically. Makes the phone think it has no service etc. I know you can (or could?) return to Apple for a fix.

My original iPhone 7 (which I had for many years) NEVER had this problem. I just had dropped it, broken the camera, drained the battery, etc and it was time to replace. I'm broke AF at the moment and wanted to go for a cheaper refurb option. So I got the same iPhone 7 with the same specs but refurbished from BestBuy. One day in had this problem. Returned it - bought another one from Amazon. Again, it had this problem but except this time on and off sometimes for days at a time. 

THE QUESTION IS: is there any world where two separate model# iPhone 7's have this issue - or could this be a problem with my AT&amp;T account or my sim card (the only common denominator between the 3 phones). I know a refurb is a sketchy option but I just don't want to spend the cash on a new phone - especially if this can be fixed. Again, the original iPhone7 with the same sim card NEVER had this problem.

gwd36k,"""New"" iPhone X Won't Activate My brother gave me his old iPhone today as a graduation present. It's an iPhone X, and the one I currently use is an iPhone 7. I've been trying all night to set up and activate the new phone, but it won't work. I connected it to my computer, but it kept telling me to connect to a computer even though I already was, or it would say that I am indeed connected to a computer, but do nothing else. 

Many, many times it had me enter in my Apple ID and password, load for a bit, and not do anything. On my computer, in the iTunes app, I located the device on there because it was plugged into the computer, and it also kept having me enter in my Apple ID login info over and over again. I would type my password, it would load, and then take me right back to the login screen. A couple times, it's said that an unexpected response or something like that occurred in the device, but I didn't do anything on it.

What's super weird to me is that my iCloud info, everything from my old phone, etc is on the new phone, but only when the SIM card isn't in. When I put the SIM card in, it stays on a screen that says ""update is complete."" When I click on continue, it tells me to connect to a computer when I'm already connected, or just that I'm connected but nothing else. I have absolutely no idea what to do. It has my background, apps, old texts, contacts, photos, etc. but only when the SIM card isn't in it. I have no idea what to do, and I don't even really know how to describe this issue.

(iPhone 6s)

So recently I deleted about 5000 photos from my camera roll. I tried to delete them from my recently deleted folder but it didn’t work. 

After that I decided to update to IOS13 and I saw that the 5000 photos had disappeared from my recently deleted folder. However when I checked I saw that the storage stayed the same, so I think that I have around 10gb of photos stored somewhere but I just don’t know how to delete them... 

When I connect my iPhone to iTunes it does show me that I have 10gb of free storage, but it then quickly changes to show me that I have no free storage left...

gw9mni,"Question about downsizing iPhone XR Thinking about downsizing...A few questions and advice needed!

I want to downgrade my iphone 10R to a smaller model. This phone is in very good condition.

I used to have the original iphone SE. Could get it for about 150. The new SE seems to be around 400.

I’m essentially wondering how much value I could get out of my current phone if I were to trade it in. It’s in very good condition like I said. Would they give me a straight swap for the new SE? Would I have to pay 100 bucks or so? More than that? 

Like I also mentioned, the SE original is about 150 online. Would it be a mistake (from a financial standpoint) to try and sell my current phone and buy the original SE? I’m trying to get as much value out of this as I can.

This post might be a bit jumbled but if someone could decipher and potentially give me some advice that would be much appreciated.

gw3wu7,"Replaced iPhone 7 battery and now no Taptic vibration. Replaced Taptic since and still not working. Help! I replaced my iPhone 7’s battery a few weeks ago and when it came back on the vibrations were a lot more intense than they were before.  Then the next day the vibrations were gone completely.  So I ordered a replacement Taptic Engine part and replaced that, and it still isn’t working.  

Anyone have any ideas?  

Additional info:  

When I first finished the battery replacement I realized the ribbon cable that connects the charger port and microphone were unplugged.  I plugged them back in and the phone was boot looping.  I then realized that when that ribbon cable was unplugged I could boot the phone all the way up, but obviously the phone wouldn’t charge and I’d have no microphone.  I then found a happy medium where I’d plug the ribbon cable in, but only gently and then I’d have a working phone, until the Taptic Engine went out the next day.   

Is the microphone/charger port that connects to the main board in any way related to the Taptic Engine?  I’m wondering if there’s some damage to the ribbon cable connection that is causing all the problems...?  I’m tempted to open my phone back up to mess with that one ribbon cable that was causing the boot loop issues to see if I get anything at all out of the Taptic Engine.

gv9anc,"Need a way to get a special alert for certain emails So, I've got an especially important client and I want to get loud email alerts that will wake me up when they contact me. They email me at my Gmail account and I need to figure out how to get a special alert for these emails. Tried the following:

- Set up a Gmail filter, forwarded the emails to an iCloud account, set up a special notification tone for the Mail app. This doesn't work because the Mail app absolutely refuses to constantly check (pull) mail no matter what I do. The alert will come hours later or when I open up the app.
- Set up a Gmail filter that forwards the email as a text to my phone and set up a custom alert for that sender. It still only pings with the normal alert tone. No idea why.
- Created a new Yahoo mail account, set up Gmail to forward the emails there, and set IFTTT to call me when any emails are received at Yahoo, but IFTTT just refuses to check my email.

gvgohn,"Can I get Applecare on a replacement phone? So my 11's back glass shattered (while it was in an otterpop case, not sure how it happened), and even though we bought Applecare originally when we got the phones, the person whose card was being used for the monthly billing got a new card and forgot to update it, long story short our Applecare expired through unintentional lack of payment and we couldn't get it back. 

So I took it to our local Apple service provider and they said what they would have to do is send it in and get a new phone, same phone, for $429. Simply replacing the back glass was not an option, according to the store.

gv28gv,"Catch-22 logging into iMessage and Apple ID with a new phone. Hi!  I just switched to an iPhone (former Android user), and I've been having some trouble getting the calling and texting functions to work.  Here's the situation - 

**Phone Model:** iPhone SE

**Purchase date:** within the last two weeks; my family ordered them as a group

**Country:** United States

**Nature of purchase:** personal use

**OS:** not sure, probably the most recent one

**The issue:**

I recently switched to iPhone from Android, and did not have an Apple ID until today.  I created one and linked it to my email, but have not been able to link it to my phone number.

iOS appears to have created a Catch-22, where I can't send or receive texts through iMessage, or receive calls on the call function, because I haven't activated my phone number on Apple ID; and I can't activate my Apple ID because doing so requires me to receive either a text message or a call on this phone.

**What caused the issue:**
It just came this way.

**Attempted solutions:**
I've tried sending a text message to myself (it failed to send), and I've checked my email and spam folder for iMessages I could have received (none found), since one of the settings says I can receive iMessages there too.

I also tried turning off iMessage in the Messages settings.  This still hasn't allowed me to send messages to myself, which makes me think there might be some kind of problem with my phone number not being attached to this phone.

Does anyone know a way to get around this problem?

gu9ul0,"FaceTime call from ""me"" to my mom I had to spend way too much time today convincing my mom that I had not FaceTimed her earlier in the day. My mom was on another call when she received a FaceTime call from me. She answered it. The video did not show a person, but rather was just sort of blurry or appeared as though the phone was laying flat and looking at up at the ceiling or down at the ground. When my mom said hello, the person on the other end said ""whoops I didn't mean to do that"" and ended the call. It was not me. She went through her missed calls and saw another missed call from ""me"" from yesterday. There is no record on my phone that I made any FaceTime calls to her (and I certainly know that I did not make them). 

The contact information associated with the call was all my contact information. It appears that when she clicked on my name in the missed call log, it just took her to her contact information entry for me.

AND, when she clicked on the missed call entry, it initiated a FaceTime call with me, which I answered.

gt4tev,"Malware? Calls cut in and out, battery drainage. Specs: 
iPhone 8
13.3.1
2017 sometime, Canada
No warranty 



Problem:

• for the past week and a bit, I’ve frequently had calls on my phone and discord cut in and out or sound distant from either end, interchangeably. My battery also, seems to be draining quicker. (My battery is at 88% the capacity as when store purchased)


Replicating:

Making a call or receiving a call by phone or calling app. 
Battery obviously drains itself. (It can be sitting and drain around %5+ within half an hour.)


What I’ve tried:

Sliding the sounds bar up and down, silent mode off, turning off many background apps refreshing, deleting some apps. Problem persists. 


Possible causes:

3 months ago, I purchased some cheap ear buds to use and they seemed to permanently mess up the way it reacts to headphones. It will trigger Siri when putting apple headphones in and it will rapid cycle through music or pause and play as if possessed etc. I no longer use headphones with it. 

Other notes:

As I type this, I noticed when an alarm came on, it displayed the volume button as if I were altering it from the external buttons. 

Body of phone is not hot; app battery consumption looks like what I’d assume it to be. 

I hear back and forths as to whether or not iPhone can contract malware. I use an ad blocker and try my best to stay away from any site I’m unsure of. I regularly clean the safari cache and monitor my network. 

Not trying to come across as paranoid, just not sure 100% what to attribute it to. I’m pretty opposed to factory resetting but if it’s the only solution, I accept that. But I’d love any other suggestions.

My Iphone 11 pro has been having an issue over calls/facetime/zoom recently. 

Whether I am on wifi or calling over network, and regardless whether it's a regular call, facetime video/audio, or even zoom, the people I am on the call with will hear my audio cutting out. This happens quite frequently, and happens in the middle of speaking. I cannot figure it out. The phone is up to date, it's been restarted, etc, but there has been nothing to improve this.

The fact that it happens regardless of network/application makes me think it's a phone hardware issue; however, if the mic was bad or something I would just assume my outgoing audio wouldn't work at all.

I have a XS Max running 13.5, but ever since mid-November (whatever version of 13 was running) I did a factory settings reset and then started facing issues with the search feature not working on native apps (notes, settings, spotlight search, etc). As of Sunday, I updated to 13.5 and noticed that the coronavirus tracking feature wasn’t showing up anywhere (I live in America, a country where it’s available) and the mask detection/immediate passcode prompt doesn’t work, either.

gqsrex,"About a month into moving from Android and I hate it. Is there hope? I've been using Android since day one. I finally decided to make the switch after breaking my Galaxy S10 and receiving an iPhone 7 for free from a friend.

I'm aware that I took a massive step back as far as hardware goes, but I still feel like the baseline experience is lackluster and I'm really frustrated. I have a suspicion that hardware isn't the source of my issues and it's more of an iOS problem. Hopefully you can fill me in.

My first complaint is the notifications. I miss shit all the time. It seems like if I don't see a text as it comes in I lose it to the ether. Android has persistent icons in the top bar to indicate notifications. As far as I can tell the only equivalent in iOS is the badges on icons. Am I missing something important?

The second and definitely most annoying is the keyboard. I can't type worth a damn on this thing. It autocorrects words for seemingly no reason. I've tried using gboard to help the transition but it seems to be suffering from the same issue. Is there an OS level problem here? Am I just used to nicer screens?

Almost everyone else in my life is on iPhone so I would like to try to make it work. I'm not opposed to shelling out for a new phone if it will solve my issues. I just saw the free phone as a great chance to try it out.

gov91x,"Calendar/contacts disappeared - any way to recover? All, thanks in advance for any help;

I’ve got an iPhone 6 with 12.4.4. Purchased in 2014 in the US for personal use. 

As of like midnight last night, everything was fine. When I woke up this morning my calendar (I use the Apple default app) was gone and so were almost all of my contacts. 

Things I’ve looked at:

I am still signed in on the iPhone. 

I checked and all the calendars are clicked to show in the app - just now only the holidays have anything. (The other options besides Holidays are Work and Home; not sure what I used before but it was just whatever the default was.)
Checked iCloud, only to discover that my phone wasn’t backing up to iCloud :(

—-

Things I have not done:

Signed out and back in to my phone (don’t want to lose my safari tabs and I don’t know if they’re part of the backup I did earlier today or if signing out will lost them; concerned that logging out &amp;amp; in will “lock in” the problem). 

There is also my concern that signing out will apparently delete, like everything? I can restore from a backup, but won’t that just leave me in the position I’m in?

Updated to the newest iOS (also concerned that updating will “lock in” the problem)

Restored from iCloud (apparently my phone hasn’t been backing up to iCloud; yay)

—-

Things I’m not sure about:

My most recent backup was from 2/1 - is there any way to restore just the calendar and contacts from that backup, or is it an all or nothing thing?

Thanks again!

ETA: Since this happened, I just tried to add something to my calendar and noticed that it picks “Work” as default. I’m all but positive that wasn’t the case before. Was there something other than “Work” or “Home” that I could have been adding to?

I completely forgot the password and tried anything I could remember, getting myself locked out and today it came up with the screen ""iPhone is disabled. Connect to iTunes."" 

I've never backed up this phone or connected it to a computer and most of it was not backed up into iCloud.

go74ii,"iPhone X - Caught in a boot loop.  

My iPhone X is currently caught in a boot loop. I bought it off a friend the other day who told me it was caught in the loop, but I bought it hoping to fix it.

I tried restoring it in both regular restore mode, and even DFU mode but I got the same result both times.

What happens is, it after I run the restores, they appear to complete like normal. When I try to start the phone, or it attempts to boot afterwords, then it shows the apple logo for a few moments; from there it quickly shows an image of the apple logo + the loading bar graphic, then instantly shuts off / restarts after showing a minimal amount of progress on the loading bar.

Yesterday, when I was getting out of the car, the phone fell out of my lap and hit the ground softly in its case, and did no damage to the phone, but it then randomly booted up properly and allowed me to setup the phone.

Today, the phone died and now its caught in the same boot loop as before. Any ideas? I've tried smacking it around a bit but no luck so far. I'm also currently trying to restore it again.

I'm almost certain the phone is no longer under warranty, and if the problem is so dire that it would require repair/replacement beyond what I am able to do myself, I'll just buy a new one. So I wouldn't dwell on this.

- What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

The issue is as follows; when using the Phone app to make a call, I can hear whoever I am calling just fine, but they are unable to hear me. They are able to hear me when I plug in headphones, or use the speaker phone, but not when I hold the phone to my ear. The problem started yesterday and has been replicated on every call I've made since, regardless of the app used. (e.g. Facebook Messenger).

- What caused the issue?

Unknown.

- What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

I have tested the microphone in the voice memo's app and it picks up sound fine. I reset the network settings on the phone as well as the general settings. I did a soft reset on the phone. I've turned off Bluetooth. I have cleaned the lightning port to the best of my ability. I have turned off noise canceling in accessibility.

- Any other information you think might be useful.

The problem seemed to spring up out of no where. I haven't made any software updates or anything that might have acted as a catalyst I don't think. The strangest thing to me is that the headphones and speaker phone will both transmit audio, but not the standard mic. Furthermore, it's strange to me that the standard mic can detect sound in the voice memos app, but will not send it out over any kind of call.

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. I'll be monitoring this closely and trying anything suggested.

UPDATE: I'm still testing things. When I rub my thumb over the bottom microphone in a call, the person on the other end can hear it.",2,0,,0,2,TheRacAttack,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphonehelp/comments/gn2tst/iphone_not_sending_audio_during_phone_calls/,1,2020-05-20 10:22:59,1589941379.0,0

gmbkdg,"iOS 13 cameras don't work (broken TrueDepth?) I've got an iPhone X.  I dropped it a while ago and messed up the TrueDepth camera; Face ID will no longer activate.  That's frustrating but not the end of the world, as the front and rear cameras still worked fine in iOS 12.  

When iOS 13 first came out I upgraded (this would have been 13.0 or 13.1). Unfortunately, through either a bug or by design, the cameras wouldn't work after upgrade.  The camera app just showed a black screen for both front and rear camera, and taking a photo just resulted in a black photo.  

I downgraded back to iOS 12 and the camera app worked fine again. Does anyone know if the current version of iOS 13 still require the TrueDepth camera to be functional in order for the rest of the cameras to work? I'd like to upgrade to iOS 13, but... you know... cameras are more important. I forgot to save the bits that let you downgrade to an old iOS at a later date, or I would test it myself :/

glg4x1,"iPhone 8 [13.1.1] : Messages defaulting to iMessage for Android SMS recipient. Thanks in advance for anyone that can help.

The recipient has a Mac with usage of the iMessage platform and an Android phone.
The messages tend to default to iMessage despite the selected phone number being Android.

If I have sent an iMessage to the recipient earlier in the day and then I want to send a text message, even though I select the mobile number (rather than the associated iMessage email address) it defaults to blue text in the ‘To’ section.

Even if I go ‘new message’ and type in the Android phone number manually, it still defaults to blue. Copy and pasting makes no difference either. 

If I hard press and ‘forward’ the message after it defaults to iMessage, it’s usually the same issue. I don’t think I’ve seen a ‘send as SMS’ option pop up. 

If I go to the contacts and find the person, go ‘message’ and then ‘mobile’ or select their number, it will still set the ‘To’ text to blue/iMessage.

Even if they SMS me, and I try to reply straight back, it will tend to default to whatever I had used to message THEM last, and if it’s an iMessage to their Mac, it almost creates a cycle. I hope that makes sense?

It’s been doing this for some time, and is variable/intermittent with no pattern, despite undertaking the last few iOS update, restarting the phone, restating the messages app and turning iMessages on and off. 

Is anyone else struggling with this? I suppose it’s probably something technical, but it can be really irritating if you’re trying to contact someone with something important and they don’t see the message straight away, because it will be sitting in their email inbox instead, if their Mac isn’t open!

Side note: I feel like I can still select numbers fine through my Mac, so I hope it’s not some weird communication issue between my iPhone and Mac. I have got messages synced with iCloud too, if that would be make any difference to the issue.

gl82zq,"Old Imaginary Apple ID included in iCloud Backup So we just went through the broken screen song and dance. It doesn't respond to anything, so we can't even link the phone to a Computer (The last computer we linked the old phone to was broken down into it's component pieces with the HD was wiped ages ago. -.-) to salvage the ripped CDs on it. Which is worse because the Backup HD for those rips is ALSO dead (Protect your Tech when you Move Folks!). So we cried at our losses and purchased a ""New to us"" iPhone. Thankfully no drama there, and we were able to restore our backup Almost no problem.

In the course of restoring the backup, it mentions something about ""Some Content"" being attached to a seperate Apple ID and it asks for the password to that ID. The E-Mail displayed has never ""Intentionally"" been used for anything Apple Related, as it is not a real E-Mail. It looks like some kind of perversion of an E-Mail address someone might imagine they had based on their existing E-Mails, and they remember having some E-Mail related headache related to the old iPhone back when they first bought it and took it to an Apple ""Genius"", but nothing ever seemed to come of it. We've checked all relevant places to make sure its not hiding attached to one Apple service or another, but Everything (Facetime, Messages, iCloud, etc.) has the correct E-Mail attached.

The best I can figure is that ""Something"" (An App, a Song, Etc.) *must* have been ""Purchased"" with that nonexistant ID back when the first phone was new, but goodness only knows what. How can we find and remove the offending content to keep the iPhone from incessantly prompting us? That way we can rid all trace of it, and make a new backup without it. We tried to reset the password for it, but of course, they want to send an E-Mail to the imaginary E-Mail Address... which won't work for obvious reasons. -.-

All the ""Official"" help resources say to change to that imaginary address and then change back, but as it doesn't exist, we couldn't get any of the verification E-Mails were we to try such a thing.

I recently bought a Samsung Fit e fitness band. I downloaded the Samsung Health app and paired it with the Fit e.

The reason being that my health insurer app will only allow the Apple Health app to give it data.

Next, I ran the whole device under tap water for 6-8 secs to partially rinse it off (to make drying it afterwards easier). Home button lost haptic feedback? I’m hoping it’s just a matter of any remaining soapy water drying up before the home button’s taptic feedback starts working again. I’m just worried the soap/water may have somehow gone into the crevices around the home button and messed with the fingerprint sensor, or somehow affected the general internal area near where the home button is located.

The home button itself is still working (e.g. bringing up Siri, unlocking phone, going back home, etc.), however I don’t seem to be getting the vibration that comes with a normal press of the iPhone 7 home button. The closest thing to a vibration that I’m getting is a small distorted squishy sound resembling its click when I press home.

gk7dxy,"Extremely Strange Safari Problem Hey everyone. Hoping for some help. Having a really odd problem with Safari on my iPhone XS Max, with 13.4.1 OSX.  Phone was purchased in October 2019. 

Today I pulled up safari and went to type in a web address that began with the letter “S.”  The keyboard froze and so did safari. No big, kill the app and reopen. It’s still stuck on the same page. Kill it a second time and relaunch. It reverts back to the last page I was on. Go to type in the address again and it locks up. Every time I type in “S” as the starting letter it locks and I have to close and open, close and open. 

Did the simple stuff like reboot the phone, and went into web data and started deleting any sites starting with “S” that had any actual data next to it (as opposed to 0.0mb). 

I can type every other letter of the alphabet except for “S”. I’m not sure when this started because the last few days I’ve most stuck to my favorites. 

I’m sure the simplest answer is to clear history and web data. But I’d like to avoid that. 

I can, however, start with “www.s” and get to the site. Also, I’ve got no issues starting with S in my Firefox browser. 

I’m totally perplexed by this. Like I said, clearing all history and web data is the obvious place to start but I’d like to avoid that.  

Has anyone experienced this, or have any ideas?

gkbbo4,"recovering data/photos from an iPhone that isn't backed up Last night my iphone (2017 SE) gave me the white apple screen of death.  My memory was nearly full and I was in the process of trying to delete photos and apps to free up space.  Now, it stays in the white apple screen of death and does not advance to anything else (except see as follows).  The phone is not recognized when I plug it into my laptop, and iTunes does not recognize it either. 

I have tried putting it in recovery mode (holding power + home buttons) and get the black screen with a lightning cable aiming at a laptop.  At this point, iTunes prompts me to try to update the version of iOS on the phone.  I attempted this, and it failed.  Now it says I must restore the phone.  However, I don't have anything backed up (stupid me, I know).

giaghn,"Recover data from before factory reset Before I start, I'm an idiot and I've learnt my lesson, please don't tell me this, I know.

My last backup was from about a year ago on my old phone.

My 11's memory was full and I've been backing up videos slowly to dropbox. I was trying to delete stuff to clear out the memory yesterday morning but it wasn't responding so I tried to restart it, this sent it into a boot loop. Tried all the tricks to get it out but it would only stop while I was holding the power button after force restart (spent all day doing this).

A message came up on the screen to connect to a computer and gave the link to [support.apple](https://support.apple). something or other so I followed it. Went to itunes and it said it would download the latest ios and try to fix it, but that if that didn't work I would need to do a factory reset, clicked okay and it went straight into a factory reset but I didn't realise what it was doing (it said it was 'restoring' and my stupid ass thought it was restoring ios).

In a panic I set it to load the last backup I had which turned out to be the one from over a year ago.

Is there anything I can do to recover my original files?

I'm willing to do pretty much anything at this point. Illegal, costly, whatever, I don't care. This thing had pictures of my dead grandmother, lost pets, people and pets I'm stuck 300 miles away from in this lockdown.

Charging very slowly, the charging port also doesn’t stay connected as in it’s always in but goes on and off charge. This has only recently happened - it was great when I bought it.

Same when it’s connected to a computer and I tried to download my pictures off the phone to my PC - it kept disconnecting and if it was connected I’d get an error half way through the download saying “ device unresponsive”.

gh2ep8,"Spotify control goes away from audio control Hey all, new here but have been having this issue for about a year and haven't been able to find any solutions. I just got a new phone (the new SE) which I was hopeful would fix the issue but unfortunately it did not...

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, you have the built in audio controls (in the control center, lock screen, or using buttons on headphones). Tehse all work fine, but for some reason when i'm listening to music in spotify (which is 99% of the time), those controls will sometimes just go away. So then I have to open the app to pause, skip songs, restart music if I stopped to watch a video, etc. It's obviously a relatively minor inconvenience but I'd love to get any ideas if people have them for why this is happening and what I can do to avoid it!

ggqv16,"XS spazzing out and twitching like its being touched a lot  

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*XS on 13.3.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

USA on the date it was released from best buy for personal use

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

I noticed trying to back out of an app in the top left of the screen it wasn't registering touch. then it just started spazzing out like i was scrolling or touching everywhere. It eventually chilled out after sleeping it and waking it. But every couple of minutes it tweaks out again really crazy. when I try to text someone it scrolls up in their convo up and up. Someone sent me a message on IG and just trying to unlock the phone it opened the message and then started typing random shit and emojis. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

seemingly nothing. I have not dropped it or got water on it. It pretty much just sits on my couch next to me during all this. I live alone so its not like I have a kid that messed with it and isn't telling me. 

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I cleaned off the screen. then tried holding side button to turn off, which was hard because the upper area of the screen doesn't always sense touch so I couldn't swipe it to turn off. then I did the vol up vol down side button hold to reboot. 

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

Over a year ago I cracked the screen and got it replaced at a third party repair place called UBREAKWEFIX or something. It was fine except when I put it on the wireless charger it would do this same ghost touching twitch thing but I brought it back to them and they said it may have been a shit digitizer. they replaced it and everything has been good since then.

I’m a student and recently got the new SE after saving up for a while and I absolutely love it so far. The only problem I’ve been having (and it seems to be a common problem) is that all the screen protectors that I’ve bought and tried that say they will fit the iPhone 8 / new SE leave huge air bubbles along the sides of the phone. I’m guessing that the SE screen must be more curved than the 8? Either way, it’s a really annoying problem and I can’t bear to use a protector with the big bubbles on the sides. 

I’m wondering whether I should just give up and not bother with a screen protector, or whether I should just keep trying different protectors until I find one that fits. Has anyone managed to find one so far that doesn’t leave these air bubbles? If not, would it be reasonably safe to just put a bumper case on the phone and keep it in a phone pouch or sock or something when putting it in my bag? I am worried about breaking the screen since like I said, I’m a student and funds are tight.

&amp;#x200B;

When I plug the iPhone into my computer, Windows makes a sound and my phone asks me if I want to trust this computer. I click Allow and then nothing happens. The iPhone appears as a device in my Windows explorer, but not in iTunes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both the iPhone and iTunes are on the most recent versions. I have tried multiple lightning cables and have rebooted multiple times. Outside of uninstalling iTunes, I'm not sure what else to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it absolutely necessary I backup/sync my phone if I already did a direct transfer to my new iPhone SE? If it is not, can I just sign out and wipe my iPhone 6s and mail it into Apple so I can get trade-in credit?

gffnlg,"iPhone Storage issue Hi there, so my gf has been having some pretty bad storage issues and with the current pandemic she cant get it into a store or let me look at it etc so ill try explain it all as best as possible.

iPhone 7 Plus 32gb. with 25gb iCloud storage. There are about 5 apps on the phone as she has tried to delete them all to save storage. Curretly on iOS 13.2 but cant update the software because of the storage issue.

Both iCloud and phone storage were full so she deleted apps etc photos but after this happened the storage never updated but the apps are gone and then photos would say they are deleted by then re appear shortly after. Her photos take up the most space but no where near the 25gb she could use the cloud to store them in.

Another issue that old photos become blurry and cant be viewed properly. Why is this?I've tried to point her to a few things but havent been able to resolve it. Some apps started to show a cloud with an arrow i think next to them before they were 'deleted'.

Anyone have any ideas to help resolve this? I tried the apple forums and then told me to check the storage and delete stuff, yes I have already done that unsurisingly haha.

I recorded a few videos on my iPhone - they were in landscape orientation, and recorded with the front (selfie) camera.  The videos seemed to record fine - the record button showed that a video was being made, and I could see the video on the iPhone's screen as it recorded.  But then, when I navigated to the video on my iPhone, it was just sound and a static grey screen (no picture).  I've tried to open it in photos and a variety of Mac apps (like VLC and Handbrake), but either I only get audio with no picture or some variation of an error message that the file can't be opened.  

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this?  Once I noticed the videos seemed to be corrupt, I recreated the error a few times - videos shot in landscape on the front camera turned out this way, while shot with the back cameras or in portrait mode worked fine.  This isn't alwasy the case, though - sometimes I am able to record playable videos with the front camera in landscape mode.  (I just provide this info in case it's helpful.  I'm happy to record using the back camera going forward, but I would like to be able to get these existing corupted videos to play.)

gdsqyi,"(HELP) Need to Take Low Res Photos Hi there!

So for work I take tons and tons of photos everyday (500-1000), and my company has a cloud where I upload them, but in order to conserve space I need them to be small files. They prefer 640x480. 

Obviously iPhone natively takes high resolution photos, and aside from changing the photo “compatibility” settings and the video resolution, I haven’t been able to find a way to take 640x480 pics with the camera. 

My last work phone was an android and I had an app that would let me take 640x480 pics, but I haven’t had any luck finding an app like this for iPhone. 

Right now I’m stuck using Microsoft picture manager to resize them after plugging into my computer after a long day of work and doing it manually. It’s a huge pain in the ass, and would save me so much time if I could make them low resolution right from my iPhone, and upload them on the spot using my data. 

Does anybody know of any apps or hidden settings that can help with this?

All input is much appreciated.

gdmcm3,"iPhone photos to Windows 10 I'm having really annoying problems backing up my wife's photo's to my PC. I'm an android user so please bear with me if my knowledge seems stupid. I haven't had an iPhone since the 4 (briefly with the 7 but never plugged it into a PC). My wife has 10'000's of photos and I'd like to put what I can on my PC and eventually into the cloud. I'd do this directly to google cloud but I don't want it running in the background all day, I can schedule this on my PC run in the small hours of the night (bandwidth isn't amazing so i don't want it ruining our internet during the day).

1. It's my understand that iCloud and her phone are fully synced and I cannot have stuff in the cloud but not of the phone?  
If this is the case my aim here is to add them to my google drive, as I believe she can download google photos and view things on her phone and it seems there's workaround to have it delete photos from the phone but not the cloud.
2. First thing I did was plug it into my PC and from memory. It worked like a USB stick for photos. I was simply going to copy and paste them.  
It's only showing me a handful of photos in a handful of folders. 103APPLE, 105APPLE...107,1108 111,117,121,125 and 126. Some are empty, some have a single photo in them and the last one has about 20.   
I tried using photos as per apple's instructions but just see's the above photos.   

3. I previously set up iCloud on my PC to sync with a folder on my PC. It's hasn't synced since January (I know it's been on as I've seen it running on several occasions. 
4. Iit's on now and not doing everything). I ran it not long ago and it's downloading 26,000 items. I suspect I'm getting more duplicate copies of photos. I had previously seen it up to date. It was easy to set up on my C drive but a pain in the ass (and I work in IT) to set up on a secondary drive. Ideally, I don't use iCloud as it's a hunk of shit and I've tried to use it several times over the years and is by far the most troublesome program I've ever had to deal with (and I have many clients that use all sorts of weird and wonderful programs).

gdgmxf,"iPhone 11 regularly gets stuck on Twitter app Hello I have had a persistent issue with my iPhone 11 for a little over a month now. I am running the latest version of ios 13. 

My issue is that every other or so (with now increased regularity) my phone will get stuck on an app (so far it has been twitter approximately 5 times and Instagram once). When this issue occurs the app that my phone is stuck on remains fully functional, and I still receive notifications from other apps and can view them from the pull-down menu. If I click on the apps though I cannot switch apps. I am unable to use the swipe bar to view other open apps, or access the home screen. If someone calls me my phone will vibrate but the prompt to answer the call is never brought up. If I hold the power button to attempt to power off the phone it brings up siri and never brings up the screen to swipe and power off the phone, the same occurs when I attempt to restart the phone. Connecting my phone to my laptop has not resolved the issue either. 

Currently, when the issue occurs I simply wait for my phone to die, plug it into a charger and restart it. However, what was once an issue every couple weeks has no happened with more regularity. My phone is currently acting up and the did so as well last Friday (5/1) which was 3 days ago.

This is NOT to do with the iCloud.  I don’t have any of the photos of videos online and I don’t have the camera roll online for it to download.

But I’ve deleted a whole bunch of stuff and made plenty of space now.

gd2w5n,"Message Notifications Don't Work When Phone is Locked **Phone Model:** iPhone 11 running iOS 13.4.1

**Purchase Date/Location and Use:**  October 2019 from the apple website in the US for personal use

**The Problem:** When I receive a text message/iMessage notification while my screen it locked, the screen does not wake, does not vibrate, and there is no ding/vibration when in ringer mode either. I do not have these problems if the screen is awake and locked or awake and unlocked. Occasionally the notifications will work properly immediately after locking my phone, but majority of the time, the notification simply doesn't work. I still get banners, badges, and even the lock screen icon bar. Notifications for all other apps work normally almost all the time.

**What I've Tried:** I have tried everything I can think of including: changing all notifications settings, hard restarts/shutdowns, updating the phone (this happened before 13.4.1), simply changing sounds and vibration patterns, covering/uncovering the light sensor (I don't know why I thought this would change anything), etc. Nothing has changed the problem.

**What Causes the Issue:** The only thing I can identify that causes the issue is locking the phone screen. I haven't found anything else that causes the issue.

What could possible be causing this issue? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

gcvtr1,"HEIC images taken on iPhone X are larger than Apple's Image Capture exports TL;DR: Image Capture on the Mac is exporting HEIC images smaller than they were stored on the iPhone. Am I losing photo quality here and if so how do I transfer my iPhone's photos exactly as they are saved on the device?

Full Details: 

To make use of all the time we've got right now as a result of the quarantine, I've been collecting all my photos from various different devices over the years and storing them in one location ready to upload to the cloud.  

Although I had my fair share of issues with some Android phones, trying to get the photos off my iPhone X onto a Windows PC has been nothing short of a nightmare. I won't go into it too much here but I want to upload these photos into the cloud as JPG's not HEIC's, however, iOS's automatic conversion feature does not work at all and crashes everytime I try to move the folders over. I also get the same result when I turn on the 'Keep Originals' option. 

After much frustration, I've decided to use the Image Capture application on my Macbook Air to just move the entire library over to a USB as HEIC's. Then I'll find a good converter to change them into JPG's. When I compare the exported file on my USB to the exif data of the exact same photo on my iPhone X though, I'm noticing massive size differences. Often entire megabytes... 

I want these transferred photos to be the same quality as they are on the phone itself. That's why I haven't used any 3rd party transfer tools, to avoid a loss in quality. Image Capture seems to be doing this anyway though. 

Does anybody understand why Image Capture is exporting my photos at a drastically lower size than the originals and how I can get around this at all?
